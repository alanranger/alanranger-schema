      "name": "Why did you want to become a photographer?It was something that I had an interest in when I was a teenager at sixth form college but unfortunately, other things took over and became a priority. It was always something I wanted and knew I would come back to later in life so I'm happy that I'm now finding time to devote to it. 2.    Were you scared or anxious to start out?Not to start learning and using my camera but definitely scared and anxious when it came to sharing my images. I have always dealt with and am more comfortable with facts and figures so doing something creative and putting yourself out there to be critiqued in a subjective environment was something very alien to me and initially not that enjoyable but I think if you can take the “what the hell” approach and let people comment, then the feedback is invaluable in getting you to the next stage.     3.    Why did you select Alan as your tutor?I was referred by a colleague who had attended his intro course and he sent me the link to his website. His images were just inspiring, typically in the genre that most interested me and of a quality that I could only dream of achieving. The fact that he was also relatively local was an added bonus.",

      "name": "What was your main motivation to commit to Alan’s tuition?I was getting frustrated both with the quality of my images and also that I wanted to go out and use my camera but was lacking direction and intention of what I wanted to shoot.  The monthly mentoring changed my way of thinking and gave me a clear vision of what to do. It may not always have been in a genre that I enjoy or was comfortable with but that was still so much better that my previous wishy-washy approach.  5.    What type of tuition have you had from Alan?Monthly MentoringLightroom Post ProcessingIntermediates CourseOne to OneWorkshopsCritique Masterclass6.    How do you feel Alan’s teaching style has helped develop your skills the most?In the nicest possible way he is brutally honest. Sometimes it’s not what you want to hear but it’s the only way to learn. That aside he still make you feel relaxed and at ease, enjoys the banter with the groups and is not above taking on-board student comments and working with them in areas where he himself is not quite so comfortable.  His love of photography and what he does is infectious to be around.7.    What are the key things Alan has helped you with?Probably the main one is composition and I’ve still got so much to learn as it’s definitely my weak spot and the element that I constantly fight with!Being able to critique you own images and understanding what you have struggled to correct post process so you know what to look for next time you go out to shoot or how you should change your workflow to accommodate avoiding the same mistakes.",

I rarely shoot without having a clear vision of what I'm trying to achieve, my hit rate(although still poor) is definitely improving, my confidence to share image has grown and my mind set to accept, understand and absorb the critique of my images to help me improve has completely changed for the better.   9.    Could you describe how you felt when you were featured in the intermediates photography exhibition?Nervous but excited none the less! I guess it goes back to the confidence to put yourself out there to share you images. I had invited friend, family and colleagues to the opening night so I didn't know how they would react but in hind sight overwhelmed by their positivity and support.",
