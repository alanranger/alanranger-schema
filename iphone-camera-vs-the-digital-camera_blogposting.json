I don't actually disagree - in fact in my view it does have a great camera but in what context? If you are measuring the iPhone's camera capability against other smartphones then you would probably be hard pushed to find a lot better. However, as any owner of a digital bridge or DSLR camera knows, the smartphone camera's just don't pack the punch when it comes to viewing your photo on a screen size larger than 5x3 inches.The smartphone camera does have one huge advantage over all other camera's - it's generally always on you! As I found out earlier this week, on a short break in Devon with my 7yr old daughter, you can't always have your favored gear with you - especially when you are in the company of family who are not so patient when it comes to creating photographs.Sometimes you just have to use what you have, however imperfect that maybe, and however much you know it won't be as good as what you could create with your preferred set-up.So here are a few shots taken with the iPhone 5, whilst away.

With advancements in smartphone technology, many are questioning whether they still need a traditional digital camera. This article provides an in-depth comparison to help you make an informed decision.UNDERSTANDING THE BASICSPHONE CAMERASModern smartphones are equipped with powerful cameras that offer convenience and impressive features.
