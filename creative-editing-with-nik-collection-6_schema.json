AND WHEN IT COMES TO CREATIVE EDITING, THE DXO NIK COLLECTION IS A NAME THAT STANDS OUT. THE NIK COLLECTION HAS BEEN A PHOTOGRAPHER'S FAVOURITE FOR YEARS WITH ITS POWERFUL PLUGINS AND INNOVATIVE TOOLS. AND NOW, WITH THE RELEASE OF DXO NIK COLLECTION 6, THERE ARE EVEN MORE EXCITING FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXPLORE.THE EVOLUTION OF NIK COLLECTION 6The NIK Collection has come a long way since its launch in the '90s. Over the years, it has changed ownership several times, but its reputation for its black-and-white and colour film looks has remained legendary. Today, DXO is the proud owner of the NIK Collection, and they continue to improve and enhance the software with each new version.INTRODUCING NIK COLLECTION 6NIK Collection 6 by DXO is the latest version of this powerful photo editing suite. Packed with new features and improvements, it offers photographers even more control and flexibility in their editing process. Whether you're a professional photographer or an amateur enthusiast, NIK Collection 6 has something to offer.ENHANCED U POINTTM TOOLOne of the standout features of NIK Collection 6 is the enhanced U PointTM tool.

This innovative tool has been upgraded with new Control Lines, allowing you to combine the power of Control Points with the flexibility of linear gradients. With Control Lines, you can create graduated filter effects with precision and ease. Whilst this is an excellent addition to the plugin, I tend to make this type of adjustment in Lightroom before using NIK or refine it after using NIK.In addition to Control Lines, the U PointTM tool now includes Color Selectivity filters. These filters allow you to tie the impact of Control Points and Control Lines to the brightness and colour of specific parts of your image. This level of control gives you unparalleled precision in your local adjustments.INVERTED AND DIFFUSED ADJUSTMENTSNIK Collection 6 introduces the ability to invert and diffuse your Control Points and Control Lines. This means you can apply adjustments to specific areas of your image and then easily reverse or soften those adjustments as needed. This level of flexibility allows you to experiment and fine-tune your edits confidently.IMPROVED WORKFLOW FEATURESIn addition to the enhancements to the U PointTM tool, NIK Collection 6 also brings a range of improvements to the overall workflow.

This means you can keep track of all your fine edits and easily access them whenever you need further adjustments.Another helpful feature is choosing where you want the adjustment sliders to appear. You can keep them in the sidebar for a clean interface or have them on top of your image for easy adjustments. NIK Collection 6 also allows you to save your local adjustments as part of your presets, making it even easier to apply quick changes to your images.SMART OBJECTS AND PRESETSNIK Collection 6 introduces new features that make your editing process even more non-destructive. You can now turn your edits into Smart Objects, allowing you to make adjustments without permanently altering your original image. This gives you the freedom to experiment and make changes without fearing losing any critical details.Presets are another powerful tool in NIK Collection 6. You can now search for presets by name, making it easier to find your favourite edits. With just a few clicks, you can apply your saved presets to your images, saving you time and ensuring consistency in your edits.UPDATED AND REBUILT PLUGINSNIK Collection 6 brings updates and rebuilds to several of its plugins.
