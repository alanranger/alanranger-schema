The advantage of using a NAS drive is its built-in RAID 5 configuration, which provides both speed and redundancy. This setup spreads the data across multiple drives, ensuring that even if one drive fails, my data remains safe and accessible. It offers a balance between storage capacity, data protection, and performance, making it ideal for securely managing large collections of RAW image files.By using NAS with RAID 5, I not only achieve redundancy, but I also benefit from easy access to my photos from any device on my network.

      "name": "What is the 3-2-1 backup rule for photos?The 3-2-1 backup rule is a well-established strategy for protecting your data. It involves keeping 3 copies of your data, storing these on 2 different types of media, and ensuring 1 copy is stored offsite. This method minimises the risk of data loss from hardware failure, theft, or natural disasters.2. Can I rely solely on cloud storage for backing up my photos?While cloud storage is a great option for offsite backups, it's advisable not to rely on just one method. Using the 3-2-1 rule, you should combine cloud storage with a local backup, such as an external hard drive. This ensures redundancy in case the cloud service experiences issues or if you lose internet access.3. What’s the best cloud storage service for photos?Amazon Prime offers unlimited photo storage, making it an excellent option for photographers, especially those working with RAW files. Other good choices include Google Drive and iCloud, though these come with storage limits depending on your subscription plan.4. How often should I back up my photos?It’s recommended to back up your photos as soon as possible after adding new images to your collection. If you’re a professional or hobbyist photographer, creating an automatic or scheduled backup routine using tools like GoodSync can ensure your data is always up to date.5. What’s the difference between synchronisation and a backup?Synchronisation ensures files across different devices are always up to date, meaning changes on one device are reflected on others. However, it may not provide full protection, as deletions or errors may sync across devices. A backup, on the other hand, creates a separate copy of your data, protecting it from loss even if the original is deleted or corrupted.",
