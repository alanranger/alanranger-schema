Students will learn how to manipulate white balance in various lighting conditions to enhance their photography skills.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the different white balance settings and their applications. * Learn how to shoot with a grey card for custom white balance. * Experiment with creative white balance adjustments to influence mood and tone.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Familiarize yourself with your camera's white balance settings. * Obtain a grey card or a neutral reference card for custom white balance. * Select a consistent lighting environment for your shoots to minimize color casts. * Ensure your camera is set to shoot in RAW format for maximum editing flexibility. * Charge your camera battery and have sufficient memory card space for the session.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use apertur lect a consistent lighting environment for your shoots to minimize color casts. * Ensure your camera is set to shoot in RAW format for maximum editing flexibility. * Charge your camera battery and have sufficient memory card space for the session.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field while letting the camera adjust shutter speed. * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 to maintain consistent image quality. * Explore using the Kelvin scale for precise control over color temperature. * Understand the implications of mixed lighting and how to adjust white balance accordingly. * Use the white balance eyedropper tool in post-processing for RAW images to correct color casts.CREATIVE FOCUS * Experiment with warming up or cooling down the white balance to create different moods. * Use white balance creatively to make skin tones appear more natural under mixed lighting. * Introduce color casts intentionally for artistic effects in your compositions. * Balance the key light source with white balance adjustments to enhance your subject. * Consider the emotional impact of color and adjust white balance to align with your artistic vision.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Shoot a series of portraits in different lighting conditions (tungsten, daylight, shade) using auto white balance and compare results. 2. Use aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set shutter speed; shoot a scene with a grey card to establish custom white balance. 3. Capture an outdoor scene during golden hour; adjust white balance settings to emphasize warmer tones and document the results. 4. Photograph a still life object under fluorescent lighting with the camera set to its fluorescent white balance preset and evaluate the color accuracy. 5. Experiment with custom white balance using a grey card; shoot the same scene multiple times and adjust the Kelvin temperature for creative exploration. 6. Use shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set aperture; photograph a moving subject in mixed lighting, adjusting white balance to capture natural colors.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of images that showcase extreme adjustments to white balance (e.g., very warm and very cool) and discuss the visual impact of each. * Conduct a comparative analysis of JPEG vs. RAW files focusing on white balance correction capabilities in post-processing.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do use a grey card to set a custom white balance for accurate color representation. * ✓ Do experiment with different white balance presets to see their effects on your images. * ✓ Do keep your camera set to RAW for more flexibility in post-processing. * ✓ Do take notes on the lighting conditions and white balance settings used for each shot. * ✓ Do review your images on a calibrated monitor to assess color accuracy.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely solely on auto white balance in challenging lighting situations without checking results. * ✗ Don't forget to adjust your camera settings if the lighting conditions change. * ✗ Don't shoot in JPEG if you want to correct white balance extensively in post-processing. * ✗ Don't ignore the impact of color casts from mixed lighting when setting white balance. * ✗ Don't skip using a grey card when possible; it provides a reliable reference.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did different lighting conditions affect your ability to achieve accurate colors? * In wh ng. * ✗ Don't ignore the impact of color casts from mixed lighting when setting white balance. * ✗ Don't skip using a grey card when possible; it provides a reliable reference.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did different lighting conditions affect your ability to achieve accurate colors? * In what ways did using a grey card improve your workflow for setting white balance? * How can creative white balance adjustments impact the mood of your photographs? * What challenges did you face when working with mixed lighting, and how did you resolve them?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is White Balance In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
