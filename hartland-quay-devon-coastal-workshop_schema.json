      "articleBody": "NORTH DEVON COASTAL WORKSHOP | WHY I LOVE HARTLAND QUAYHartland Quay in Devon has been one of my favourite coastal locations for photography. Since my first visit there, 8 years ago, in 2011, I have returned nearly every year since to run workshops on this x-rated coastline. It has a special connection for me because it’s the location that two images were taken for my first, of three that year, award-winning entries into the Landscape Photographer of the Year competition back in 2013.Landscape Photographer of the Year - 2013Hartland Quay certainly isn’t an easy terrain to access and it’s not suited to those who are a little unstable on their feet or are not able to walk and step across large boulders. However, for those who are reasonably confident the short scramble across the boulders and rocks rewards you with endless amazing composition opportunities and the chance to practise various exposure times to create wonderful water movement between the long sculptured rock formations.We normally try to include the Hartland Quay shoreline three or four times depending on weather and tide times, but there are also plenty of less hazardous areas on the beach and cliff faces if you prefer something more sedentary.View fullsizeRock Formations on the beachView fullsizeOr maybe you can focus on bigger vista shots looking over to Lundy Island or the cliff face from the safety of the beach or from the views from around the hotel where we stay.View fullsizeView f f you prefer something more sedentary.View fullsizeRock Formations on the beachView fullsizeOr maybe you can focus on bigger vista shots looking over to Lundy Island or the cliff face from the safety of the beach or from the views from around the hotel where we stay.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeSunrise and sunset light can be amazing at Hartland and it’s literally a roll out of bed to be on the beach to maximise the shooting time.If we get the right light and tide combined then Hartland is hard to beat for drama and coastal photography.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeI am still very proud that this image is used for the pub sign (my only pub sign to date) on the cliff edge “Wreckers Retreat”View fullsizeView fullsizePub Sign with my image taken in 2011Whilst Hartland itself is a feature of the weekend workshop and will be our base we also explore other parts of the North Devon Coastline too. In between tide times, we visit nearby spots that provide a rest-bite from incoming tides and allow you to work under less time pressure and at a more relaxed pace.Sandymouth, for example, has some amazing shoreline and provides a different proposition of seaweed and rock;View fullsizeCroyde also has some great rocks that slither into the washView fullsizeSandymouthWhen the tide is out we work on using whatever light, contrast and style works for the shorelineView fullsizeCroydeView fullsizeWestward HoOther locations are equally fruitfulView fullsizeHeddons MouthView fullsizePLACESSmall Groups - Maximum 3 x All Inclusive + 3 x Tuition Only - (minimum of 3 attendees)SUITABILITYThis particular seascape workshop is suitable for those who are comfortable with stepping over boulders and rocks or happy to work on other beach areas that don’t require that hazardous journey.
