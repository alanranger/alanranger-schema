For example, if you roll a 4 (kilometers), 2 (miles), and 6 (east), set your camera to f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode and travel 4 kilometers east, photographing anything that catches your eye. 2. Once at your destination, switch to f/8, 1/125s, ISO 400 in manual mode, and capture a series of 5 images focusing on textures and patterns you encounter within a 10-meter radius. 3. After completing the first round, roll the dice again and travel to a new location. Use f/2.8, 1/60s, ISO 800 in shutter priority mode to capture the ambiance of the new setting during golden hour. 4. Choose one of your photos from the previous tasks and create a diptych with another image taken from a different angle or perspective. Set your camera to f/4, 1/125s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode to capture the second image in natural light. 5. Invite a friend to join you for the next round of dice rolling.
