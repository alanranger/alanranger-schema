Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Ensure your camera is fully charged and has sufficient storage. • Familiarize yourself with your camera's ISO settings and modes. • Select a location with varied lighting conditions. • Choose subjects that will allow you to test the limits of ISO and noise. • Prepare a notebook or digital device for taking notes on your settings and evaluations. The Assignment Technical Focus • Set your ISO to a fixed value (e.g., ISO 200) to control noise levels. • Experiment with different aperture settings to see their effect on depth of field. • Use different shutter speeds to observe how they affect motion capture. • Evaluate the quality of images taken at various ISO settings in low light. • Pay attention to the noise levels in your images and identify settings that minimize it. Creative Focus • Explore creative compositions that require low light settings. • Use shallow depth of field to highlight subjects while managing ISO. • Incorporate movement in your shots to see how ISO affects motion blur. • Try different lighting conditions, such as dusk or dawn, to challenge your ISO settings. • Experiment with textures and patterns in low light to assess noise impact on detail. Assignment Tasks • Use aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set shutter speed in a dimly lit room to capture detail without excessive noise. • Set your camera to shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, capturing moving subjects in a park to assess how ISO affects motion clarity. • In a twilight setting, use aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed while observing the noise levels in your images. • Set your camera to shutter priority mode at 1/60s with ISO 200 fixed in a low-light indoor event, capturing the action while evaluating the noise in your shots. • Use aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed during a sunset to explore how changing light impacts exposure and noise. • Select a busy street scene at night and shoot in shutter priority mode at 1/125s with ISO 200 fixed, focusing on the effects of ISO on both sharpness and noise. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Experiment with ISO settings at 400, 800, and 1600 in various lighting environments to analyze how noise increases with higher ISO. • Capture a series of images at the same aperture and shutter speed but varying ISO settings, then create a visual comparison of noise levels. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do keep your ISO as low as possible for the best image quality. • ✓ Do utilize aperture priority mode to control depth of field while managing ISO. • ✓ Do practice in different lighting environments to understand ISO's effect on noise. • ✓ Do take notes on the settings used for each shot to analyze results later. • ✓ Do review your images at 100% zoom to assess noise levels effectively. DON'T • ✗ Don't set ISO to auto; choose a fixed value to control noise. • ✗ Don't ignore the impact of high ISO on image detail and quality. • ✗ Don't use manual mode for this assignment; focus on priority modes instead. • ✗ Don't forget to evaluate your images after shooting to understand the effects of your settings. • ✗ Don't aim for perfect images; focus on understanding the relationship between ISO and noise. Reflection Questions • How did varying ISO levels affect the quality and detail of your images? • What challenges did you face when shooting in low light with fixed ISO? • How did different aperture settings influence your shallow depth of field and noise levels? • In what situations did you find that higher ISO was necessary, and how did that impact your images? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Iso In Photography • → Exposure Bracketing A Guide For Photographers For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
