With this tool, you can generate an artificial depth map for your image and apply blur based on that map. The result? Stunning images with a professional-looking bokeh effect.The AI-based depth blur feature in Lightroom Classic 13 offers a range of options and controls to achieve the desired effect.

The large palette visually represents the selected colour, and you can adjust its destination colour for remapping.

With Point Colour, you can achieve professional-grade colour adjustments without leaving the Lightroom environment.WHAT’S NEW IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC - ENHANCED PERFORMANCE: A SEAMLESS EDITING EXPERIENCEIn addition to these major feature updates, Lightroom Classic 13 also brings several performance improvements to enhance your editing workflow.

I’ve watched several, but this was the best one for an overview. He didn’t cover the new file formats of Jpeg XL, and I think many are currently looking at the new format and weighing up the gains of smaller file sizes versus any loss of quality - so the jury is still out on whether this is a better format.----------------------------------------What’s New In Lightroom Classiclightroom , photography-basics , photography-courses , photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 12 October 2023Alan Ranger Photography lightroom , editing-photos , news LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 &url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alanranger.com%2Fblog-on-photography%2Fwhats-new-in-lightroom-classic-13]",
