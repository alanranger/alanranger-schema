Alnwick Castle, made famous by its appearance in the Harry Potter films, is another must-visit location for photography enthusiasts. The Magic of Sunrises and Sunsets As Northumberland is located on the east coast of the UK, it offers spectacular opportunities to capture stunning sunrises and sunsets. The village of Beadnell, with its picturesque harbor, provides a perfect vantage point to witness both sunrise and sunset from the same spot. Imagine watching the sun slowly rise over the Farne Islands, capturing its warm glow with a long lens. Alternatively, the reflections of a colorful sky on the receding tide of Bamburgh Beach create a mesmerizing scene that is a delight to photograph. Mastering Long Exposures The rugged coastline of Northumberland also presents a fantastic opportunity to experiment with long exposure photography. By using dark filters in front of your camera lens, you can create ethereal and otherworldly effects. Slowing down the shutter speed to thirty seconds or more allows you to capture the movement of water, transforming it into a misty and tranquil element within your images. The result is a collection of simplistic and calming photographs that evoke a sense of serenity and awe.
