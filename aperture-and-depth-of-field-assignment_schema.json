By experimenting with different f-numbers and compositions, students will learn to control what appears sharp and what remains blurred, enhancing storytelling through their photographs.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the relationship between aperture settings and depth of field. * Learn to isolate subjects using shallow depth of field. * Master techniques for achieving deep depth of field in landscape photography.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a subject that can benefit from either shallow or deep depth of field. * Select a location with varied backgrounds to test depth of field effects. * Ensure your camera is set to Aperture Priority mode (A/Av) or Shutter Priority mode (S/Tv). * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200. * Bring a tripod for stable shots when using slower shutter speeds.THE ASSIGNMENTTE Select a location with varied backgrounds to test depth of field effects. * Ensure your camera is set to Aperture Priority mode (A/Av) or Shutter Priority mode (S/Tv). * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200. * Bring a tripod for stable shots when using slower shutter speeds.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use a wide aperture (e.g., f/2.8) to create shallow depth of field for portraits. * Utilize a narrow aperture (e.g., f/16) for landscapes to achieve maximum sharpness. * Experiment with different focal lengths to see how they affect depth of field. * Focus on the nearest eye when capturing portraits to ensure sharpness. * For landscapes, focus slightly beyond the nearest detail for optimal depth.CREATIVE FOCUS * Try to tell a story through selective focus by isolating key elements in your composition. * Incorporate foreground elements to enhance depth when using shallow depth of field. * Vary your angles and perspectives to see how they influence depth of field. * Create a series of images with varying depth of field for a cohesive narrative. * Use depth of field to guide the viewer's eye towards the main subject.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed to photograph a portrait, focusing on the subject's eyes while blurring the background. 2. Set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/16 with ISO 200 fixed and capture a landscape scene to achieve sharpness from foreground to background. 3. Experiment with different focal lengths by taking the same portrait at f/2.8 and f/4 while changing your distance from the subject. 4. Use shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a moving subject, allowing the camera to set the aperture for optimal depth of field. 5. Shoot a close-up of a flower using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, ensuring the background is softly blurred. 6. Capture an image of a street scene at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed for a balanced exposure.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a diptych showcasing the same scene with both shallow and deep depth of field effects, using aperture priority mode for both. * Challenge yourself to use hyperfocal distance principles in a landscape shot by setting your aperture to f/11 with ISO 200 fixed.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do experiment with different aperture settings to see their effects on depth of field. * ✓ Do focus on the most important element in your composition to ensure it remains sharp. * ✓ Do use a tripod for landscape shots to avoid camera shake at slower shutter speeds. * ✓ Do review your images to analyze how different depths of field affect your storytelling. * ✓ Do practice switching between aperture and shutter priority modes to see how they influence your creative choices.DON'T * ✗ Don't use manual mode with all settings specified; focus on priority modes instead. * ✗ Don't forget to check your background for distractions that may affect your depth of field. * ✗ Don't assume that shallow depth of field is always better; consider the context of your subject. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose and adjust settings for optimal results. * ✗ Don't limit yourself to one type of subject; explore various scenes to understand depth of field.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does manipulating aperture change the story you can tell with your images? * In what situations do you find shallow depth of field most effective? r optimal results. * ✗ Don't limit yourself to one type of subject; explore various scenes to understand depth of field.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does manipulating aperture change the story you can tell with your images? * In what situations do you find shallow depth of field most effective? * What challenges did you encounter when trying to achieve deep depth of field? * How does the choice of focal length influence your depth of field outcomes?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Depth Of Field * → What Is Aperture In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
