      "name": "Since then she has remained a loyal and repeat customer and has also become a friend to me.  Right from the start Joyce didn't try to hide her lack of knowledge of camera operation, composition and making images the way she felt about them.  In fact it would be fair to say that she has always been the first to laugh at and question her own images and methods.Joyce knows what she wants to achieve (most of the time) and even when she has not crystallised her thoughts she has always been very open to trying something new even when it doesn't necessarily appeal to her natural subject preferences.Joyce's journey has not been without some hiccups along the way in her image production, but in my view this has been one of her greatest strengths and reasons for such a dramatic progression.  She doesn't take herself to seriously and we have always had a good amount of banter between us, in addition it's always been a two way street when it comes feedback and advice, which I have really appreciated.Joyce's persistence to improve is a shining example to anyone wishing to take up photography as a hobby - as I remarked to her about a year ago \"you're hooked\" and she said \"I know and I love it\" - this attitude has led Joyce to travel to many corners of the UK in pursuit of creating images and discovering heart warming moments in those environments.Joyce is currently working on her RPS Panel for Licentiaship distinction  - I am enjoying supporting this next stage of her development which followed a great set of images for the Intermediates Course and Intentions Photography Exhibition in 2014.Well done Joyce and thank you for your support, friendship and honesty.",

I've been like that ever since!5.    How do you feel Alan’s teaching style has helped develop your skills the most?He has a very direct and honest style and he completely respects my intelligence – he doesn't do flannel or give false praise. That suits me – he tells me quite candidly what is right or wrong with my efforts and I listen and do my best to learn.He sets high expectations and can be quite demanding – but that's like an unspoken agreement between us. I want to be as good as I can be and he wants that too. I like that he sets the bar high.I should also stress that Alan has a lively sense of humour and the sessions are good fun - we get on well. It wouldn’t work otherwise.6.    What are the key things Alan has helped you with?I was a complete novice and so I needed to learn all aspects of photography – technical know how, composition, the importance of light – you name it, I'm learning about it!",
