Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Choose a subject that can benefit from either shallow or deep depth of field. • Select a location with varied backgrounds to test depth of field effects. • Ensure your camera is set to Aperture Priority mode (A/Av) or Shutter Priority mode (S/Tv). • Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200. • Bring a tripod for stable shots when using slower shutter speeds. The Assignment Technical Focus • Use a wide aperture (e.g., f/2.8) to create shallow depth of field for portraits. • Utilize a narrow aperture (e.g., f/16) for landscapes to achieve maximum sharpness. • Experiment with different focal lengths to see how they affect depth of field. • Focus on the nearest eye when capturing portraits to ensure sharpness. • For landscapes, focus slightly beyond the nearest detail for optimal depth. Creative Focus • Try to tell a story through selective focus by isolating key elements in your composition. • Incorporate foreground elements to enhance depth when using shallow depth of field. • Vary your angles and perspectives to see how they influence depth of field. • Create a series of images with varying depth of field for a cohesive narrative. • Use depth of field to guide the viewer's eye towards the main subject. Assignment Tasks • Use aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed to photograph a portrait, focusing on the subject's eyes while blurring the background. • Set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/16 with ISO 200 fixed and capture a landscape scene to achieve sharpness from foreground to background. • Experiment with different focal lengths by taking the same portrait at f/2.8 and f/4 while changing your distance from the subject. • Use shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a moving subject, allowing the camera to set the aperture for optimal depth of field. • Shoot a close-up of a flower using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, ensuring the background is softly blurred. • Capture an image of a street scene at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed for a balanced exposure. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a diptych showcasing the same scene with both shallow and deep depth of field effects, using aperture priority mode for both. • Challenge yourself to use hyperfocal distance principles in a landscape shot by setting your aperture to f/11 with ISO 200 fixed. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do experiment with different aperture settings to see their effects on depth of field. • ✓ Do focus on the most important element in your composition to ensure it remains sharp. • ✓ Do use a tripod for landscape shots to avoid camera shake at slower shutter speeds. • ✓ Do review your images to analyze how different depths of field affect your storytelling. • ✓ Do practice switching between aperture and shutter priority modes to see how they influence your creative choices. DON'T • ✗ Don't use manual mode with all settings specified; focus on priority modes instead. • ✗ Don't forget to check your background for distractions that may affect your depth of field. • ✗ Don't assume that shallow depth of field is always better; consider the context of your subject. • ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose and adjust settings for optimal results. • ✗ Don't limit yourself to one type of subject; explore various scenes to understand depth of field. Reflection Questions • How does manipulating aperture change the story you can tell with your images? • In what situations do you find shallow depth of field most effective? • What challenges did you encounter when trying to achieve deep depth of field? • How does the choice of focal length influence your depth of field outcomes? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Depth Of Field • → What Is Aperture In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
