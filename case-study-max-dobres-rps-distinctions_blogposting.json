We started a conversation in September 2021 after Max’s first attempt at the LRPS had failed. Upon reviewing that submission, I understood why it hadn’t met the criteria, so I offered to help him create a panel of images that I felt would be to the standard required. I hadn’t anticipated that Max would complete the task with such speed and determination to be awarded his Licentiate distinction just five/six months after his first RPS mentoring class. More amazing is that only two or three images remained in his final panel from the original failed submission. Max used a mixture of group RPS mentoring classes and online 1-2-1 Zoom sessions with me to reach this rapid turnaround. The sessions concentrated on image selection, editing and how to analyse an image and every element in meticulous detail. Max also took my advice about printing, and using a professional print lab to ensure print quality was not a factor. He used One Vision Imaging Ltd, who supported him with the choice of paper and several test prints before the final panel production. Max’s successful panel demonstrates the range of subject matter, technique, perspective and photographer’s input required to meet the standard of an L with the RPS. The panel layout is balanced with tonality, colour, visual weight and capturing moments. Max has an eye for imagery, whether it be stratospheric with his Astrophotography to the micro of dials inside an engine, and then showing empathy with his portraits and captured moments. Congratulations Max; I was confident you would pass with your new panel, and I look forward to you starting your next steps into developing your photography further with projects on subjects that may take you to your Associate distinction. Interview with Max going for his RPS Distinctions1. Why did you want to gain a distinction with the Royal Photographic Society (RPS)? I wanted to improve my general photography and applying for the Licentiate with its clear criteria provided a structured approach and a goal to aim for. 2. Why did you choose Alan to mentor you for a distinction and had you worked with Alan before the RPS Mentoring Course? I had not worked with Alan before and choose him from a list of candidates from Google. I was looking for someone who was well qualified and who was focused on the RPS distinction pathway. Alan’s claim to get all candidates through the Licentiate was reassuring. 3. Describe how you found the RPS Mentoring Classes. I used a mixture of classes and individual mentoring. This enabled me to learn from the experience of others but also concentrate on my portfolio. 4. Do you feel you got the right level and input of support from the course? Yes, I got from the course exactly what I needed, by building my learning around my images and what they revealed about my strengths and needs for improvement. 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? I contacted Alan after I failed my first assessment with the RPS. I understood why images did not meet the RPS criteria but needed an experienced eye to guide me on how I should improve. 6. What distinction did you apply for and were you successful? I applied for the Licentiate and after Alan’s mentoring my images sailed through the assessment. 7. What was your experience like of the RPS Assessment Day? The Assessment Day was very successful. The judges gave me lots of positive feedback. 8. Did you seek independent advice, feedback or input from anywhere else before your panel assessment? I used my local camera club, but it would not have been reasonable to expect the same time commitment I got from Alan 9. Having completed the course and Distinction Assessment, what advice would you like to share with others? To be successful in the assessment you need to understand the RPS criteria in detail and have the advice of someone who knows what this means in practise 10. What was the hardest part of gaining a distinction with the RPS and why? It was not hard as long as you listened to exactly what Alan said and put it into practice. 11. Has working for a distinction helped you progress as a photographer? I feel my overall standard has gone up a level from interested amateur to a competent photographer with still much to learn. 12. Any other comments you would like to add. I valued Alans direct style. He told me exactly what I needed to do to get my images to the standard required by the RPS. You need to leave your ego at the door and listen.
