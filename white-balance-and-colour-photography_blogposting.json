Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Familiarize yourself with your camera's white balance settings. • Obtain a grey card or a neutral reference card for custom white balance. • Select a consistent lighting environment for your shoots to minimize color casts. • Ensure your camera is set to shoot in RAW format for maximum editing flexibility. • Charge your camera battery and have sufficient memory card space for the session. The Assignment Technical Focus • Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field while letting the camera adjust shutter speed. • Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 to maintain consistent image quality. • Explore using the Kelvin scale for precise control over color temperature. • Understand the implications of mixed lighting and how to adjust white balance accordingly. • Use the white balance eyedropper tool in post-processing for RAW images to correct color casts. Creative Focus • Experiment with warming up or cooling down the white balance to create different moods. • Use white balance creatively to make skin tones appear more natural under mixed lighting. • Introduce color casts intentionally for artistic effects in your compositions. • Balance the key light source with white balance adjustments to enhance your subject. • Consider the emotional impact of color and adjust white balance to align with your artistic vision. Assignment Tasks • Shoot a series of portraits in different lighting conditions (tungsten, daylight, shade) using auto white balance and compare results. • Use aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set shutter speed; shoot a scene with a grey card to establish custom white balance. • Capture an outdoor scene during golden hour; adjust white balance settings to emphasize warmer tones and document the results. • Photograph a still life object under fluorescent lighting with the camera set to its fluorescent white balance preset and evaluate the color accuracy. • Experiment with custom white balance using a grey card; shoot the same scene multiple times and adjust the Kelvin temperature for creative exploration. • Use shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set aperture; photograph a moving subject in mixed lighting, adjusting white balance to capture natural colors. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a series of images that showcase extreme adjustments to white balance (e.g., very warm and very cool) and discuss the visual impact of each. • Conduct a comparative analysis of JPEG vs. RAW files focusing on white balance correction capabilities in post-processing. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do use a grey card to set a custom white balance for accurate color representation. • ✓ Do experiment with different white balance presets to see their effects on your images. • ✓ Do keep your camera set to RAW for more flexibility in post-processing. • ✓ Do take notes on the lighting conditions and white balance settings used for each shot. • ✓ Do review your images on a calibrated monitor to assess color accuracy. DON'T • ✗ Don't rely solely on auto white balance in challenging lighting situations without checking results. • ✗ Don't forget to adjust your camera settings if the lighting conditions change. • ✗ Don't shoot in JPEG if you want to correct white balance extensively in post-processing. • ✗ Don't ignore the impact of color casts from mixed lighting when setting white balance. • ✗ Don't skip using a grey card when possible; it provides a reliable reference. Reflection Questions • How did different lighting conditions affect your ability to achieve accurate colors? • In what ways did using a grey card improve your workflow for setting white balance? • How can creative white balance adjustments impact the mood of your photographs? • What challenges did you face when working with mixed lighting, and how did you resolve them? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is White Balance In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
