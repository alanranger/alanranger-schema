This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of how to effectively capture compelling black and white images through careful consideration of composition, lighting, and camera settings.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the importance of contrast and tonal range in black and white photography. * Learn to compose images that emphasize texture and form without color. * Master camera settings and techniques specifically for black and white photography.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a subject that has strong textures and contrasts, such as a weathered building or a portrait with dramatic lighting. * Scout locations with varying light conditions to see how shadows and highlights interact. * Decide on the time of day to shoot; early morning or late afternoon often provides the best light fo t has strong textures and contrasts, such as a weathered building or a portrait with dramatic lighting. * Scout locations with varying light conditions to see how shadows and highlights interact. * Decide on the time of day to shoot; early morning or late afternoon often provides the best light for black and white images. * Prepare your camera by ensuring it is set to shoot in RAW format for maximum post-processing flexibility. * Familiarize yourself with your camera's monochrome mode and how it affects the histogram.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture settings like f/8 to achieve a good depth of field while maintaining sharpness across the frame. * Set your shutter speed to 1/125s to freeze motion while capturing details in dynamic scenes. * Adjust ISO to 200 for optimal image quality in well-lit conditions, avoiding noise in your black and white images. * Utilize spot metering to ensure your highlights are correctly exposed, especially in high-contrast scenes. * Set your white balance to daylight to maintain consistency in tones, even when shooting in black and white.CREATIVE FOCUS * Look for leading lines in your composition that draw the viewer's eye through the image. * Experiment with high contrast scenes where shadows dominate to create dramatic effects. * Incorporate patterns or textures to add depth and interest to your black and white images. * Use negative space effectively to highlight your subject and enhance the emotional impact. * Consider the emotional tone you want to convey; softer contrasts can evoke calmness, while stark contrasts may suggest tension.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Capture a portrait using natural light at f/4, 1/100s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode, focusing on the subject's facial textures. 2. Photograph a landscape scene at f/11, 1/250s, ISO 200 in manual mode, ensuring the sky has dramatic cloud patterns. 3. Shoot a close-up of an architectural detail at f/2.8, 1/60s, ISO 400 in shutter priority mode to emphasize texture and form. 4. Create a long exposure of flowing water at f/16, 1/2s, ISO 100 in manual mode to smooth out the water while capturing surrounding rocks. 5. Photograph a street scene at f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 800 in aperture priority mode, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow created by buildings. 6. Capture a still life arrangement at f/8, 1/60s, ISO 200 in manual mode to highlight the textures of different materials.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of black and white images that tell a story, using a consistent theme and technique across all photos. * Experiment with infrared photography in black and white, using an appropriate filter and settings to create unique tonal contrasts.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do explore different lighting conditions to see how they affect your black and white images. * ✓ Do experiment with different focal lengths to find unique perspectives. * ✓ Do use post-processing software to fine-tune contrast and tonal range. * ✓ Do study the work of classic black and white photographers for inspiration. * ✓ Do practice viewing scenes in terms of light and shadow before capturing them.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely solely on color images; pre-visualize how a scene will look in black and white. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of composition; leading lines and framing are crucial. * ✗ Don't shoot at too high an ISO, which can introduce noise and degrade image quality. * ✗ Don't forget to check your histogram to ensure color images; pre-visualize how a scene will look in black and white. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of composition; leading lines and framing are crucial. * ✗ Don't shoot at too high an ISO, which can introduce noise and degrade image quality. * ✗ Don't forget to check your histogram to ensure a balanced exposure. * ✗ Don't shy away from high contrast scenes; they often yield the most striking black and white images.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What emotions do you want to evoke in your black and white photographs? * How does the absence of color change your perception of the subject? * In what ways can you improve your composition for future black and white shots? * What challenges did you face while capturing black and white images, and how did you overcome them?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → Black And White Photography For Beginners * → What Is Contrast In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
