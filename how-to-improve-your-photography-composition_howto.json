Focusing solely on technical elements such as sharpness and exposure often results in an image that is visually correct but emotionally void. Instead, aim to capture the essence of the moment—the feelings, atmosphere, or story behind the scene.Ask yourself:Why am I drawn to this subject?What emotions or narrative do I want to communicate?How can I interpret this scene to best express what I feel?By contemplating these questions, you shift from simply documenting a scene to conveying a deeper story. Your photographs will carry more weight and emotional appeal.",

      "name": "Master the Rule of ThirdsThe Rule of Thirds is a fundamental guideline that divides your frame into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. Placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections creates a balanced and engaging composition. This rule helps direct the viewer's eye through the frame and is a great starting point for composition.  Once you're comfortable with this technique, don’t be afraid to break the rule deliberately. Experiment with off-centre compositions to add a dynamic twist to your photography.",

      "name": "Use Leading Lines to Guide the EyeLeading lines are powerful tools in photography composition that guide the viewer’s gaze through an image. These lines can be natural, like rivers or coastlines, or man-made, such as roads or architectural elements. By positioning leading lines strategically, you can direct attention to the main subject and create a sense of depth and movement within your photographs.  Leading lines are especially effective in landscape photography. Look for paths, rows of trees, or flowing water that naturally draw the eye toward the focal point of your image.",

A cluttered image confuses the viewer and dilutes the focus on the main subject. Instead, strive for simplicity by eliminating distractions and honing in on what is essential.Techniques to simplify your frame include:Getting closer to your subjectChanging your perspectiveUsing a shallow depth of field to isolate your subject from the backgroundMinimalism in photography emphasises the beauty of simplicity. Employing negative space, focusing on one subject, and using the Rule of Odds (favouring odd numbers of elements) can create a more substantial visual impact.",

      "name": "Balance Visual WeightBalance is about distributing visual elements across the frame in a harmonious way. Symmetry, achieved by mirroring elements on either side of the frame, creates a sense of stability and order. On the other hand, asymmetry, which uses contrasting sizes, shapes, or colours to balance a composition, adds dynamism and interest. Achieving balance is not limited to symmetry alone. Asymmetry can be just as effective when used thoughtfully. The goal is to ensure the image feels stable and intentional.",

When used effectively, negative space adds simplicity and tranquillity to an image.  Be mindful of how much negative space you incorporate.

Using elements like foreground, middle ground, and background layers adds dimensionality, drawing the viewer into the scene. Techniques such as using a wide-angle lens or adjusting your camera position can emphasise depth.
