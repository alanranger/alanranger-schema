In other words, the larger 10×8” print’s aspect ratio is squarer. Common Photograph Sizes - Aspect Ratio",

      "name": "(1600/200=8). So, there you have it. A file size of 2,000 pixels X 1600 pixels can be printed to make a good quality 10 X 8 photo when printed at 200 DPI. If you decide to make a print at 300DPI from the same image file, you will have a print with better resolution. However, the maximum size for a quality print will be smaller.  The maths would be.... 2,000/300=6.8. Next, 1,600/300=5.3. So, if you round the numbers out, the maximum standard size for that print will be about 7 X 5.  The key connection to viewing distance here is that due to the optics of the human eye, a print that is 3x farther away requires exactly 3x less resolution to maintain the same visible quality! So, in the case of the 36\" x 54\" image, having 1/3 of the resolution at 100 PPI is equally compensated for by the 3x longer viewing distance. Though printing a fine art photograph at 100 PPI is considered completely unacceptable to some, if a photographer intends for a large print to only be viewed from 8 feet away or more, this is reasonable.",
