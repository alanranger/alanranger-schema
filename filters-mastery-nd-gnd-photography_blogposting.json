The Assignment Technical Focus • Use ND filters to achieve longer exposure times without overexposing your image. • Incorporate GND filters to control the brightness difference between the sky and ground. • Adjust your aperture for depth of field while letting the camera manage shutter speed. • Utilize Polarizer filters to increase color saturation and contrast in your images. • Experiment with various strengths of ND filters to see their impact on exposure. Creative Focus • Capture flowing water in a river or waterfall using ND filters to create a silky effect. • Use GND filters during sunrise or sunset to prevent blown-out highlights. • Frame a scene where reflections in water can be enhanced using a Polarizer filter. • Experiment with landscape compositions that take advantage of enhanced colors from Polarizer filters. • Create abstract images by using long exposures with ND filters to blur moving subjects. Assignment Tasks • Use ND filters to photograph a waterfall in Aperture Priority mode at f/11 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed for a smooth water effect. • Shoot a landscape during golden hour with a GND filter in Shutter Priority mode at 1/125s with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera adjust aperture for balanced exposure. • Capture a vibrant sky with a Polarizer filter in Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed. • Photograph a busy street scene using ND filters to achieve motion blur while in Shutter Priority mode at 1/60s with ISO 200 fixed. • Use a GND filter to photograph a sunset over a lake in Aperture Priority mode at f/16 with ISO 200 fixed, letting your camera adjust the shutter speed to maintain depth of field. • Create a series of images that showcase the difference polarizing can make in colors and reflections, using Aperture Priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Combine the use of both ND and GND filters in a single shot during the daytime, ensuring proper exposure using Aperture Priority mode. • Create a time-lapse video of a sunset using ND filters to control exposure, while switching between different filter strengths. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do experiment with different filter strengths to see their effects on exposure. • ✓ Do practice setting your camera to the correct mode before shooting with filters. • ✓ Do use a tripod for stability, especially in low light situations. • ✓ Do take test shots to check for exposure and composition before finalizing your shot. • ✓ Do clean your filters before use to avoid unwanted spots or haze in your images. DON'T • ✗ Don't forget to check the histogram to ensure you are not overexposing your images. • ✗ Don't use filters in inappropriate lighting conditions that could lead to poor results. • ✗ Don't manually set all three exposure variables; use priority modes instead. • ✗ Don't neglect to consider the effect of filters on autofocus performance. • ✗ Don't rush your settings; take time to adjust and compose your shot correctly. Reflection Questions • How did using filters change your perception of light and color in your images? • What challenges did you face when using ND or GND filters, and how did you overcome them? • In what situations do you think you would most benefit from using a Polarizer filter? • How did the experience of using filters influence your creative process while shooting? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Do Camera Lens Filters Do • → Are Camera Uv Filters Worth It For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
