I wanted to understand what I needed to do differently to improve my images2.    Were you scared or anxious to start out?a.    I was more excited and interested in learning new things than scared but submitting your first pictures for review is definitely a scary moment.3.    Why did you select Alan as your tutor?a.    I had decided to find a training course to learn how to get the best out of Adobe Lightroom. All the training I looked at on the internet talked about showing you what lightroom did. I really needed someone to show me how to apply it to my images. I met Alan at the Photography show and we talked about what I needed and I knew straight away his teaching style suited what I needed",

When completing my mentoring assignments I spend much more time looking at the image I am trying to take and thinking of how it could be improved. I am more a technology person than creative so while my images are technically good they could be improved. Alan’s feedback, which is targeted at you as an individual, has pushed me to improve but he has also given tips on how to improve my creative side8.    How do you think you’ve grown as a photographer?a.    My images have definitely taken a step change over the last few years, I am happier with showing my images to others and I now feel I have the skills to take even better images. I feel I am much better at critiquing my own work, in the past I would have looked and been disappointed with the picture with no idea on what to do next but now I look at them knowing what I could do better to improve it",
