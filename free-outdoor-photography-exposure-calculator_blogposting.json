And now, with this calculator, it’s easier than ever.----------------------------------------WHAT IS EXPOSURE IN PHOTOGRAPHY?Exposure refers to how much light reaches your camera's sensor when you take a photo. Too much light? Your image is overexposed. Too little? It’s underexposed. The perfect exposure depends on your subject, lighting conditions, and creative intent.There are three main settings in the exposure triangle: 1. Aperture (f-stop): Controls how wide your lens opens to let in light. 2. Shutter Speed: Controls how long your camera’s sensor is exposed to light. 3. ISO: Measures your camera sensor’s sensitivity to light.Balancing these three settings is key to achieving correct exposure—and that's where beginners often struggle.----------------------------------------WHY THIS EXPOSURE CALCULATOR IS IDEAL FOR BEGINNERSWhen you’re just starting out, there’s so much to remember.
