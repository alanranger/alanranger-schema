Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Gather your macro or zoom lens and ensure it is clean and ready for use. • Set up your tripod in a stable location to minimize camera shake. • Choose a shooting location with good natural light or prepare to use artificial light sources. • Decide on your subject matter, such as flowers, insects, or textures. • Set your camera to aperture priority mode with a fixed ISO of 200. The Assignment Technical Focus • Utilize aperture priority mode to control depth of field effectively. • Experiment with different focal lengths to discover optimal working distances. • Use a remote shutter release or timer to prevent camera shake. • Incorporate focus stacking techniques to achieve greater depth of field. • Adjust your lighting setup to minimize harsh shadows and highlight textures. Creative Focus • Explore negative space in your compositions to draw attention to your subject. • Try varying your angles and distances to create unique perspectives. • Incorporate natural elements or props to add context to your macro shots. • Experiment with backlighting to enhance the details and colors of your subject. • Use shallow depth of field to isolate your subject and create a dreamy effect. Assignment Tasks • Capture a close-up shot of a flower's petals using aperture priority mode at f/4, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed for optimal exposure. • Photograph an insect resting on a leaf, using aperture priority mode at f/5.6 to achieve sharp details while blurring the background. • Create a macro image of a textured surface (like bark or stone), using aperture priority mode at f/8 to enhance depth of field and detail. • Shoot a close-up of a water droplet on a leaf, utilizing aperture priority mode at f/2.8 to emphasize the droplet against a blurred background. • Take a series of three images of the same subject with varying focus points to practice focus stacking techniques. • Experiment with artificial lighting by photographing a small object with a flashlight or LED panel, using aperture priority mode at f/4. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a composite image using focus stacking techniques, combining multiple photos taken at different focus points for maximum sharpness. • Experiment with macro photography at night, using a tripod and artificial light sources to capture nocturnal subjects. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do use a tripod to ensure stability during macro shots. • ✓ Do experiment with different lighting sources to find what enhances your subject best. • ✓ Do review your images on a larger screen to assess fine details and sharpness. • ✓ Do take your time to compose your shots carefully, considering both the subject and background. • ✓ Do practice patience to capture moving subjects, like insects, by waiting for them to settle. DON'T • ✗ Don't rush your shots; take the time to adjust your composition and focus. • ✗ Don't use manual mode for exposure; stick to aperture priority to focus on depth of field. • ✗ Don't overlook the background; ensure it complements rather than distracts from your subject. • ✗ Don't forget to check your lens for dust or smudges before shooting. • ✗ Don't assume natural light is always sufficient; be prepared to use additional lighting. Reflection Questions • How did the use of aperture priority mode change your approach to capturing macro images? • What challenges did you face in achieving the desired depth of field, and how did you overcome them? • In what ways did the lighting conditions affect the details and textures in your macro photography? • How did experimenting with composition techniques impact the storytelling aspect of your macro images? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → Art Of Macro Photography • → What Is Depth Of Field For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
