Understanding Colour Vision Deficiency - Online Colour Test A colour vision deficiency, often referred to as colour blindness or color deficiency, doesn't necessarily mean that a person perceives the world in monochrome. It signifies the inability or difficulty in distinguishing certain colours accurately. There are different types of colour blindness, with varying degrees of severity. Some individuals may struggle more than others in discerning various hues, depending on the type of color blindness they have. The Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test - Online Colour Test To gauge the extent of your colour vision deficiency and pinpoint specific colour-related challenges, you can take the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test. This online colour test - colour blind test is a globally recognised tool for evaluating colour vision. It involves arranging colour blocks in the correct hue order, with fixed first and last blocks in each row. By taking this colour blindness test, you can gain insights into your colour perception and identify areas where you may struggle due to colour deficiency. Please note that the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test is not compatible with mobile devices such as phones and iPads. To take the test, you will need to use a desktop or laptop computer with a mouse attached. Once you have completed the test, make sure to note your score and the areas where you had difficulty identifying the correct hues. Take the online colour test based on the Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test. 👁️ What the Colour Test Measures The Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test is a globally recognised tool for assessing colour vision and perception. It asks you to arrange coloured tiles in the correct order, from one hue to another, with fixed start and end blocks in each row. By completing this test, you gain insights into how accurately you perceive colour and whether you have difficulty recognising subtle differences between hues. A low score indicates excellent colour discrimination, while a higher score may highlight areas of weakness.

If your colour vision is limited, you might unintentionally produce images with unnatural tints or tonal imbalances.

Use the ranges below as a quick guide: • 0–20: Excellent colour perception — reliable for fine grading and print work. • 21–50: Good — minor hue shifts may be missed in very subtle edits. • 51–100: Moderate — take extra care with tint/white balance and skin tones. • 100+: Limited — consider workflow aids (neutral lighting, references, second pair of eyes). Why it matters in photography • White balance: Small hue bias can push images too warm/cool without you noticing. • Skin tones & foliage: Subtle magenta/green shifts look unnatural when missed. • Printing: If your grading is off, prints won’t match the screen. If your score is higher than you’d like • Work under neutral lighting (5000–6500K) and avoid strong colour casts in your room. • Use reference tools: grey card for capture; neutral targets for editing checks. • Edit with small, A/B adjustments and take frequent breaks to reset your eyes. • Ask for a second opinion on tricky colour work (portraits, product, sunsets).

It’s a recognised assessment of hue discrimination. You arrange coloured tiles so they transition smoothly from one hue to another. A lower score means better colour perception. Why does colour perception matter for photographers? Editing, colour grading and printing all depend on accurate hue recognition. Weak hue perception can lead to subtle but persistent casts (too warm/cool or magenta/green) that look unnatural in skin tones, foliage and prints. How do I read my score? 0–20 = excellent; 21–50 = good; 51–100 = moderate (take extra care with WB/tint); 100+ = limited — use neutral lighting, reference targets and second-pair-of-eyes checks. Do I need special equipment to take the test? Use a desktop or laptop with a mouse. Mobile devices aren’t supported. View in neutral light and avoid screen night-shift modes to prevent colour bias. Can I compensate for weaker colour perception? Yes: shoot a grey card, edit under neutral lighting (5000–6500K), use reference images, make small A/B adjustments, calibrate your monitor, and get feedback on tricky colour work. A colour vision defect doesn't mean you're colour blind There are varying degrees of colour blindness, and some people may not be colour-blind at all. They have a harder time distinguishing various hues than someone with sharper colour acuity. Viewing & Printing - Why colours do not look accurate on your display or print. Have you ever wondered why the colours you see on your monitor don't match the scene you photographed or the image you printed? That's because what you see on-screen is only as accurate as your display. Fortunately, there's an easy way to fix this.
