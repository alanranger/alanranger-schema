See my post on filters for more information.The choice of lenses is always a dilemma if worry about weight or have too many options/distractions in your kit bag.  Personally, I prefer two lenses - 70-200mm and a macro lens.  However, wide-angle lenses (16-35mm) are also useful in certain situations so if you do have a set that covers a range then it might be worth the weight of carrying them - just try to avoid the I’ve carried these so am going to use them regardless syndrome! Pick the right tool for the job.At least one spare battery and memory card.  You can never have enough batteries and a spare memory card will safeguard you against the unexpected corruption issue whilst there. Tripods are beneficial for several reasons.They allow you to frame and re-compose your shot easily with small adjustments to the compositionThey stabilise your camera which will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds and still get sharp results - remember to turn off image stabilisation!When doing macro and close-ups it’s essential to use a tripod if you want sharp/in-focus results with blurred backgrounds - the slightest movement in the subject or camera will result in out of focus images.If you are panning or shooting a panoramic the tripod makes this technique much easier to produce the overall aligned shots with the scene being vertically and horizontally level.My recommended tripods - tripods-gitzo-vs-benro-head-to-head  A remote release cable enables you to take the photo without touching the camera and potentially causing vibration and camera movement resulting in a slightly out of focus shot, If you don’t have a remote release cable then use the camera's built-in 2 sec or 10-sec timer function.A kneeling mat or dustbin liner is great for doing those low down perspectives and macro shots.  Large sandwich bag or clear plastic bag to cover the camera in the event of rain.Flask of tea/coffee and snacks – It will be cold early on if you are there at sunriseWarm clothes – gloves/hat – it’s cold at sunrise in Apr/May!Wellies or walking shoes/boots – dry warm feet help you stay focusedIf you are a smoker then please take something with you to take cigarette butts away with you",

It’s true that bluebell colour will vary from purple-ish to hues of blue depending on the light temperature and time of day and weather situation.  However, if you calibrate the light temperature using a custom white balance then you know that your images won’t need further correction when back home unless it’s for aesthetic/creative reasons.Doing a custom white balance only takes ten seconds but you need to remember to re-calibrate the custom white balance every hour or as often as you sense the light changes or your photos don’t reflect the colour your eye sees.A simple and cost-effective tool for this is the white balance lens cap filter.  Make sure you purchase the right size for the diameter of your lens.  Check your camera manual for how to set a custom white balance for your particular camera.  If using a white balance preset, I recommend cloudy or shady not Auto White Balance (AWB)Set your JPG Picture Style to Neutral – You should find this in the camera menu system and it will be called something like - Creative style or Picture Style -  You are looking for the setting where there are three or four of the icons for contrast, saturation, sharpening all display as zero - meaning that the image recorded is not being artificially enhanced and the colour isn’t exaggerated fooling you into thinking your white balance is correct or incorrect.  Even if you shoot in RAW only, remember the image displayed on the back of the cameras LCD is a jpg thumbnail so will show the jpg picture style settings.  Your RAW file will not, of course, be affected by these settings.",

It’s easy to check the exposure on the image you have just taken by reviewing the histogram of the image.  - Check your camera manual on how to display the histogram for the photo your viewing.Woodland lighting can be very contrasty and cause exposure issues if you use evaluative metering as the camera tries to deal with a dynamic range of light that exceeds the range the camera can record in a single exposure.  Using graduated filters to reduce the bright areas can be tricky because you will effectively darken down tree trunks as well as sky.  You can of course bracket exposures. but then you will also need to use the software on the computer to blend them together into a single frame.  Personally, I prefer to spot meter and expose it to the right to protect the highlights and then adjust the shadows and mid-tones in post-process.Personally, my style and preference are to frame the composition without sky leaking into the top of the frame, thus avoiding dynamic range exposure issues and giving as much exposure as the camera allows to the bluebells and dark shadows around them.",

      "name": "Get the DoF right.In my view the most common mistake (mistake is probably controversial) is that beginners believe that landscape photography is about getting every aspect of the frame in sharp focus and a depth of field that starts at 1 cm in front of the camera to infinity distance.  And, when the camera doesn’t quite match that expectation they then give the image a dose of over-sharpening steroids or detail extractor in post-production.    There is no right or wrong answer to this setting or treatment other than personal interpretation and taste.  However, you have to consider how your eye sees the scene naturally and how far you wish to push those boundaries - is photography about reality (based on human perception and how the eye witnesses something) or is it about something that is an art form and therefore transcends those boundaries.  The answer to that question is a personal one so I won’t make a judgement on either side of that argument but just say that you should knowingly set your depth of field (Aperture F stop) to create the illusion that matches your intention.I have taken many bluebell woodland shots over the years and the DoF ranges from wide-open F2.8 to F6.3 with varying focal lengths to F16 but the majority of shots that match my style are generally in the lower DoF range because I want the “illusion” of the dense patch of bluebells in the distance rather than attempting to show every bluebell within 200 meters in front of me as sharp as the next.  So, when photographing bluebells be open-minded about using various apertures and focus points to experiment.",

Photographers feel immense pressure to create, record and share wondrous images from locations they visit.  That’s great in many ways but personally, I have always had a sense that just being somewhere, enjoying and appreciating, the place and moment is as important, if not more important, than the photos I go home with.  That’s a hard argument to make when your livelihood depends on attracting people to places where creating photographs is their reason for being there.  However, I also know that plenty of my clients also share the same view that actually just being there is also as important as what you take away from it, whether that’s photos that are better than before, new understanding and education or the simple joy and pleasure we get from an experience of meeting other photographers and enjoying a shared experience together. My advice is simply to enjoy the fact that you are there in beautiful surroundings, often with less than perfect conditions, but relaxed, open to new ideas and ways of photographing the same things as other like-minded people who share your appreciation of the natural world.",
