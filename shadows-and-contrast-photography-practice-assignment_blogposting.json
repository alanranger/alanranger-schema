The Assignment Technical Focus • Use a low aperture (f/2.8) to create a shallow depth of field, isolating shadows and enhancing contrast against the background. • Set your shutter speed to 1/250s to freeze motion and capture sharp details in both shadows and highlights. • Adjust your ISO to 200 for bright daylight conditions to minimize noise while maintaining image quality. • Utilize spot metering to focus on the light and shadow areas, ensuring proper exposure for contrast. • Set your white balance to 'Shade' to warm up the tones in shadowed areas, enhancing their richness. Creative Focus • Experiment with backlighting to create silhouettes, using shadows to define shapes and forms. • Incorporate leading lines created by shadows to draw the viewer's eye into the composition. • Use shadows to create patterns and textures, adding depth and interest to your photographs. • Capture reflections of shadows in water or glass surfaces to create a layered effect. • Play with the angle of light to manipulate the length and intensity of shadows for dramatic effects. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a subject in direct sunlight at f/4, 1/125s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode, focusing on the shadows cast by the subject. • Capture a scene during golden hour at f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 200 in manual mode, emphasizing the contrast between warm light and long shadows. • Shoot a close-up of an object with a strong shadow at f/2.8, 1/250s, ISO 400 in shutter priority mode, ensuring the shadow details are crisp. • Create a silhouette against a sunset at f/8, 1/500s, ISO 100 in manual mode, focusing on the subject's outline and the vibrant colors in the background. • Photograph an urban scene with harsh midday sun at f/11, 1/1000s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode, capturing the stark contrast between light and shadow on buildings. • Experiment with flash to create dramatic shadows at f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 800 in manual mode, adjusting the flash power to control shadow intensity. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a series of black and white images focusing on shadows and contrast, using a consistent camera setting of f/4, 1/125s, ISO 200 in manual mode. • Develop a photo essay that tells a story through shadows, capturing a variety of techniques and settings in a cohesive narrative. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do explore different times of day to see how shadows change with the angle of light. • ✓ Do use reflectors to bounce light into shadowed areas for balanced exposure. • ✓ Do experiment with different lenses to capture shadows from unique perspectives. • ✓ Do analyze your images post-shoot to understand how shadows and contrast affect the overall composition. • ✓ Do share your shadow photography with peers for feedback and discussion. DON'T • ✗ Don't ignore the background; distracting elements can detract from the impact of shadows. • ✗ Don't rely solely on automatic settings; take control for more creative results. • ✗ Don't forget to adjust your settings if the lighting conditions change suddenly. • ✗ Don't overlook the potential of shadows as a subject; they can be as compelling as the main subject. • ✗ Don't shoot in harsh light without considering the impact of shadows on your composition. Reflection Questions • How did manipulating shadows change the mood of your photographs? • What techniques did you find most effective for enhancing contrast? • In what ways did the time of day affect the quality of shadows in your images? • How can you apply the lessons learned about shadows and contrast in future photography projects? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → Mastering The Art Of Shadow Photography • → What Is Contrast In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
