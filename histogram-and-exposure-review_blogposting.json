By practicing with priority modes, students will learn how to achieve proper exposure while maintaining control over depth of field or motion freeze.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand how to read histograms to assess exposure levels in images. * Learn to use aperture priority or shutter priority modes effectively to control exposure. * Practice evaluating and adjusting settings based on histogram feedback.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Familiarize yourself with your camera's histogram display settings. * Set your camera to either aperture priority or shutter priority mode. * Fix your ISO at 200 to maintain consistent exposure across tasks. * Choose a location with varied lighting to test your exposure skills. * Bring a notebook to record your observations and histogram readings.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Understand the sh rity or shutter priority mode. * Fix your ISO at 200 to maintain consistent exposure across tasks. * Choose a location with varied lighting to test your exposure skills. * Bring a notebook to record your observations and histogram readings.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Understand the shape and distribution of the histogram for optimal exposure. * Learn how to identify clipping in the histogram and its implications. * Practice adjusting exposure compensation based on histogram feedback. * Explore the differences in histograms between images with varied depth of field or motion. * Use the camera’s tools to overlay histogram data while shooting.CREATIVE FOCUS * Experiment with different aperture settings to create varying depth of field while monitoring the histogram. * Use shutter priority mode to capture movement and analyze resulting histogram data. * Incorporate foreground elements to enhance compositional balance while observing exposure. * Try shooting during different times of day to observe how light affects histogram results. * Combine creative framing techniques with exposure adjustments to see their effect on the histogram.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed. Capture a portrait and evaluate the histogram for highlights and shadows. 2. Use shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze action. Photograph a moving subject and assess the histogram to ensure proper exposure. 3. Select a brightly lit outdoor scene and use aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200. Observe the histogram and ensure you're not clipping highlights. 4. In a dimly lit environment, switch to shutter priority mode at 1/60s with ISO 200 fixed. Capture a still life and analyze the histogram for shadow details. 5. Experiment with a backlit subject using aperture priority mode at f/5.6 and ISO 200. Check the histogram to ensure the subject is properly exposed without losing background detail. 6. Take a series of photos in varying lighting conditions using shutter priority at 1/250s with ISO 200. Compare histograms to see how exposure changes with light.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of images focusing on different subjects (e.g., architecture, nature, people) using both priority modes. Analyze and compare how the histogram differs across subjects. * Conduct a low-light photography session using aperture priority mode at f/1.8 with ISO 200. Capture images and assess histograms to adjust your technique based on results.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do check your histogram after each shot to understand exposure. * ✓ Do experiment with different subject distances to see how depth of field affects histograms. * ✓ Do use the exposure compensation feature to adjust for tricky lighting situations. * ✓ Do take notes on your settings and histogram results for each shot to track your progress. * ✓ Do review your images on a computer screen to analyze histogram performance in detail.DON'T * ✗ Don't ignore clipping indicators on the histogram; they can lead to lost details. * ✗ Don't shoot in manual mode for this assignment; focus on priority modes. * ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistency. * ✗ Don't rush through your shots; take time to assess and adjust each image's exposure. * ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's LCD for exposure feedback; always check the histogram.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * H priority modes. * ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistency. * ✗ Don't rush through your shots; take time to assess and adjust each image's exposure. * ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's LCD for exposure feedback; always check the histogram.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did your understanding of exposure change after using the histogram? * What challenges did you encounter while trying to achieve proper exposure with priority modes? * In what scenarios did you find the histogram particularly helpful or confusing? * How might you apply the lessons learned about histograms in future photography projects?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography * → Exposure Bracketing A Guide For Photographers For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
