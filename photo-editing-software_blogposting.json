These powerful applications cater to photographers of all skill levels, providing a wide range of features from basic adjustments to advanced editing techniques. Let's explore some of the leading all-in-one photo editors available in 2024. 1. Adobe Lightroom Classic Adobe Lightroom Classic has become a staple in the photography world, offering a seamless blend of image management and editing capabilities. Its extensive cataloguing features allow photographers to organise their work efficiently using keywords and ratings, making it an invaluable tool for those who regularly handle large volumes of images. Lightroom's organisation tools are top-notch for photo management. One of Lightroom's key strengths lies in its streamlined, professional workflow. The software provides excellent editing tools and delivers impressive RAW processing performance. For photographers who frequently work in studio settings, Lightroom offers comprehensive USB and wireless tethering support, enabling real-time image transfer and editing during photo shoots. Its mobile apps also enable editing on the go. Lightroom's recently improved masking system has significantly enhanced its editing capabilities. This powerful feature allows users to create complex masks with relative ease, opening up a wide range of selective editing options that were previously challenging to implement. The software also boasts AI-based tools, including AI super-resolution and AI denoise, which currently have no equivalents in some competing products. These tools make Lightroom one of the best photo editing software options. Another advantage of Lightroom is its seamless, non-destructive workflow with Photoshop. Users can send a RAW file to Photoshop as an object, maintaining the ability to make edits throughout the process, even when using additional plug-ins on smart layers in Photoshop. This makes it a top choice for professional photo editing software. 2. Capture One Pro Capture One Pro has gained a strong following among professional photographers, particularly those working in studio environments. Known for its excellent RAW processing capabilities, Capture One Pro offers a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance images, making it one of the best image editing software options. The software provides a robust tethering feature, allowing photographers to see their shots on a computer screen in real time as they shoot. This functionality has made Capture One Pro a go-to choice for many studio photographers who require immediate feedback and editing capabilities during photo sessions. Capture One Pro is renowned for its colour editing tools, offering precise control over colour grading and adjustments. Its layer-based editing system allows for non-destructive adjustments, giving photographers the flexibility to experiment with different looks without compromising the original image. These features make it a top photo enhancing software. 3. DxO PhotoLab DxO PhotoLab has evolved from its roots as DxO Optics Pro, famous for its lab-derived lens correction profiles and exceptional RAW conversions. The software now incorporates powerful localised adjustment tools, thanks to the integration of the Google Nik Collection's control point technology, making it a strong contender among the best photo editing apps. One of DxO PhotoLab's standout features is its unmatched de-noising technology, which excels at rescuing detail in RAW files. The software also offers an ever-growing list of lens correction profiles, ensuring optimal image quality across a wide range of camera and lens combinations. These features make it excellent photography software. DxO PhotoLab's RAW conversions and lens corrections are widely regarded as sublime, producing high-quality results that often surpass those of other editing software. The programme also includes a 'PhotoLibrary' feature with an autofill search tool, although this aspect of the software is still somewhat limited compared to more robust cataloguing systems. It's worth noting that while DxO PhotoLab offers exceptional image quality enhancements, it doesn't support Fujifilm X-Trans files, which may be a consideration for photographers using Fujifilm cameras. In conclusion, these all-in-one photo editors each offer unique strengths and capabilities. Adobe Lightroom provides a comprehensive solution with excellent cataloguing and AI-powered tools, Capture One Pro excels in studio environments and colour editing, while DxO PhotoLab stands out for its superior RAW conversions and lens corrections. Photographers should consider their specific needs and workflow preferences when choosing the best all-in-one photo editor for their work. 4. ON1 Photo RAW ON1 Photo RAW has evolved from a collection of plug-ins into a comprehensive, standalone photo editing solution with powerful AI capabilities. The software offers a blend of traditional editing tools and cutting-edge AI features, making it a strong option among photo editing tools. One of ON1 Photo RAW's standout AI features is its NoNoise AI tool, which has quickly gained recognition for its effectiveness in reducing image noise while preserving detail. This tool puts ON1 Photo RAW on par with dedicated noise reduction software. The software also incorporates AI-powered masking and cutout tools, making complex selections and edits more accessible to photographers of all skill levels. These tools can significantly speed up workflows, especially for tasks that traditionally required meticulous manual work like cropping, exposure adjustments, and color correction. ON1 Photo RAW's AI capabilities extend to its one-click adjustment tools, which have seen significant improvements in recent updates. The software can now automatically detect and enhance various elements of an image, such as the sky, foliage, and water, with impressive accuracy. It also offers a range of brushes and selection tools for more precise edits. In conclusion, these AI-powered editing tools are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in photo editing, offering photographers powerful solutions to enhance their images with unprecedented ease and precision. Whether you're looking for comprehensive editing capabilities or specialised tools for noise reduction and sharpening, there's an AI-powered solution to suit your needs. 5. Affinity Photo Affinity Photo is a highly capable photo editing software designed to offer a powerful alternative to Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom at an affordable one-time purchase price. It caters to photographers, designers, and digital artists with a broad suite of professional tools for editing, retouching, and creating complex compositions. The software supports advanced features like layers, masks, RAW processing, HDR merging, and panorama stitching, all while maintaining a non-destructive workflow. It boasts a user-friendly interface that allows for real-time editing and smooth performance, even with large files. Unlike subscription-based models, Affinity Photo is available for a single purchase, making it an attractive option for creatives who want professional-quality tools without ongoing costs. However, it lacks cataloging tools and extensive third-party plugin support, meaning users may need to combine it with other software for complete workflow management. Despite these limitations, Affinity Photo is praised for its speed, precision, and flexibility, making it a compelling choice for both amateurs and professionals looking for an efficient, cost-effective solution to their photo editing needs. Specialised Photo Editing Software While all-in-one editors offer comprehensive solutions, specialised photo editing software caters to specific needs and workflows. These tools excel in particular areas, providing photographers with powerful options to enhance their images in unique ways. DxO Nik Collection The DxO Nik Collection, originally developed by Nik Software, has become a staple in many photographers' editing arsenals. This set of applications can be used standalone or as plugins for various photo editors, including DxO PhotoLab, Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and Affinity Photo. The collection includes several powerful tools: • Dfine: Specialises in noise reduction Sharpener: Focuses on photo sharpening Viveza: Allows manipulation of colour and light Colour Efex: Offers special effect and colour adjustment philtres Analogue Efex: Provides special effects based on film photography Silver Efex: Widely regarded as the best black-and-white conversion software HDR Efex Pro: Designed for HDR imaging and tone mapping One of the strengths of the Nik Collection is its versatility. Photographers can use these tools standalone or integrate them into their existing workflow with other photo editors that support Photoshop plugins. However, it's worth noting that the standalone applications only work with TIFF and JPEG images. The ease of use and quality of results make the Nik Collection a valuable addition to any photographer's toolkit. Many users find themselves applying these tools to almost every photo they edit. For those looking to learn the ropes, numerous free tutorials and videos are available on platforms like Lenscraft. The Nik Collection is available for both PC and Mac, with a trial version accessible from the DxO website.
