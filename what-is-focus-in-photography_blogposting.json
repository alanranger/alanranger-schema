This lesson explains what focus is (and isn’t), how autofocus modes/areas work, and the simple habits that raise your sharp-hit rate fast. • Mode vs area: AF-S/One-Shot for static; AF-C/AI-Servo for movement. Choose an area that matches your subject size (single point, expanded, zone, wide/auto with eye detection). • Aim the right point: eyes for people, closest eye if angled; leading edge for wildlife/sport; avoid focus-recompose at shallow depth of field. • Technique matters: half-press or back-button focus, burst wisely, and stabilise. Depth of field, subject distance and focal length all affect what looks “in focus”. 3 key takeaways • Match AF to motion: use continuous AF and an area that covers the subject when anything moves. • Prioritise the eye/leading edge: place the active point on the critical detail; don’t rely on recompose at wide apertures. • Control the variables: keep shutter high enough for your focal length, stop down when you need more depth, and practice BBF for consistent timing. Table of Contents Show Introduction - What is focus in Photography In the nuanced world of photography, the question of what is focus photography transcends the mere act of making subjects look sharp; it is central to the art and science of capturing images that evoke emotion, tell stories, and preserve moments. Mastery of focus—a blend of sharpness, depth of field, and the interplay of focus point photography—empowers photographers to direct viewers' attention effectively within a frame. The ability to manipulate focus photos through autofocus systems, controlling the focal plane, or employing techniques like focus stacking and hyperfocal distance is vital for achieving visual clarity and depth. This critical element determines not just the subjects' clarity but also the photograph's overall impact, making understanding photo focus essential for anyone looking to elevate their photographic work. This article will explore the foundational aspects of focusing in photography, including the significance of focus points, the mechanics of camera focus, and how depth of field contributes to the perception of sharpness. It will delve into autofocus modes, from phase detection autofocus to AF-S, and the practical utilities of focus peaking and focus stacking. Additionally, readers will learn about techniques for achieving perfect focus pictures, overcoming common focusing challenges like \"why won't my camera focus\", and the role of the focus ring, among other focus techniques. By demystifying these concepts, the article aims to arm aspiring object photographers with the knowledge to harness focusing to its full potential, transforming their approach to photography through precision, creativity, and control. The Science Behind Camera Focusing: What You Need to KnowThe Basics of Camera Focusing At its core, camera focusing is the process of adjusting the lens to achieve optimal sharpness and clarity for the desired subject or area within the scene. This is accomplished by converging the light rays from the subject onto the camera's image sensor or film plane, resulting in a precisely focused image. What is Camera Focusing? Camera focusing is the act of finding the optimal sharpness of an object within the frame. A completely sharp image is said to be in focus, while a blurry or indistinct image is considered out of focus. The focusing mechanism works by adjusting the distance between the lens and the image sensor or film, allowing light to converge precisely at the desired plane. Types of Camera-Focusing Systems There are several types of focusing systems employed in cameras: • Split-Image Rangefinder: This system displays two images of the subject, which align and merge when the subject is in focus. Matte Field: A matte surface within the viewfinder aids in quick shooting and low-light situations. Microprism Ring: This system consists of numerous tiny prisms and is useful for focusing on subjects lacking distinct vertical elements. Phase Detection Autofocus: Found in modern DSLR cameras, this system uses a dedicated autofocus sensor to detect and achieve focus by analysing the phase differences between light rays. Contrast Detection Autofocus: Common in mirrorless cameras and live view modes, this system analyses the image’s contrast on the primary sensor to determine and adjust focus. How Autofocus Works in Modern Cameras The Science Behind Camera Focusing — Quick Reference Focusing moves lens elements so light converges on the sensor at the chosen plane of focus. Below are the main focusing systems and how modern autofocus (AF) methods differ. System / Aid How it works Strengths Limitations Best use Split-image rangefinder (manual aid) Two half-images align when focus is correct. Very precise on defined edges/lines. Struggles in low light/low contrast; slows shooting. Manual focus lenses; static subjects. Matte field (manual aid) Ground-glass texture shows peak sharpness. Good general manual focusing feedback. Harder at very wide apertures or dim scenes. Manual focusing, tripod work. Microprism ring (manual aid) Tiny prisms shimmer when out of focus. Quick visual cue for rough focus. Less precise; can sparkle in low contrast. Fast manual focus on mid-contrast subjects. Phase-detection AF Splits light into pairs; measures phase difference to know direction & amount to drive focus. Very fast acquisition; excellent subject tracking. Can misfocus in very low light or low contrast; requires calibration on some DSLR bodies. Sport, wildlife, people in motion. (DSLR: dedicated AF module; mirrorless: on-sensor PDAF.) Contrast-detection AF Analyzes image contrast on the main sensor; peaks at max contrast = sharpest focus. Very precise for static subjects; no AF calibration needed. Slower “hunt”; weaker for moving subjects. Tripod, product, macro, landscapes; live view. Hybrid AF Combines PDAF speed with contrast AF fine-tune (often on-sensor). Fast and accurate; best all-round performance. Can still slow in very dim/low-contrast scenes. Modern mirrorless for most subjects; eye/face/animal AF. Autofocus Methods — At a Glance AF method Speed Precision (static) Tracking (moving) Low light / low contrast Notes / best practice Phase-detect ★★★★★ ★★★★☆ ★★★☆☆ Use AF-C/servo with subject-appropriate area; micro-adjust (DSLR) if needed. Contrast-detect ★★☆☆☆ Best on tripod/static scenes; use magnified view/peaking for precision. Hybrid (on-sensor) Enable eye/face/animal detect; choose zone that fits subject size; refine with contrast AF if needed. Note: Many modern mirrorless cameras use on-sensor phase detection (PDAF) alongside contrast AF for hybrid performance. Modern cameras employ two primary autofocus (AF) systems: phase detection and contrast detection. These systems work in tandem to provide accurate and efficient focusing capabilities. Phase Detection Phase detection AF is a hardware-based system that uses an array of microlenses to split incoming light into pairs of images. By measuring the distance between these image pairs, the camera can determine whether the subject is front or back-focused. This information is then used to instruct the lens on how to adjust its focus accurately. The phase detection system works as follows: Light enters the lens and is partially reflected by the primary mirror onto a dedicated AF sensor. Microlenses on the AF sensor divide the light into pairs of images for each active AF point. The separation between these image pairs is analysed to calculate the required degree and direction of focus adjustment. The camera instructs the lens to move its focus ring accordingly until the subject is perfectly sharp. Phase detection AF is swift and precise, making it ideal for tracking moving subjects in sports or wildlife photography. Contrast Detection Contrast detection AF relies on software algorithms to analyse the contrast levels within the image captured by the camera's main sensor. The system scans the scene, rapidly adjusting the lens focus until the highest contrast (sharpest detail) is achieved for the desired subject. While contrast detection AF is generally slower than phase detection, it offers superior accuracy for stationary subjects. It works by: Evaluating the contrast levels across the image sensor. Adjust the lens focus incrementally while monitoring contrast changes. Locking focus when the maximum contrast is detected, indicating optimal sharpness. Hybrid Systems Many modern cameras combine phase detection and contrast detection AF into a hybrid system, leveraging the strengths of both technologies. This approach allows for fast and accurate focusing in various shooting scenarios. Hybrid AF systems can switch between phase detection for quick subject acquisition and contrast detection for precise fine-tuning. Some advanced implementations combine data from both systems simultaneously, resulting in exceptional autofocus performance. By understanding how these autofocus systems operate, photographers can better utilise their camera's capabilities and capture sharper, more compelling images. Basic Concepts of Focus Quick Tips — Plane of Focus & Depth of Field • Plane of focus: the razor-sharp slice where light converges on the sensor. At wide apertures (e.g., f/1.4–f/2) it’s thin—place it on the critical detail (eyes for people, leading edge for wildlife). • Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: moving the camera changes focus distance. Move the AF point to the subject instead; use eye/face detect when reliable. • Three levers for DoF: aperture (smaller opening → more DoF), distance (farther → more DoF), focal length (shorter → more DoF). Use them together to get the look you want. • Practical starts: headshots f/2–f/2.8; couples f/2.8–f/4; small groups f/4–f/5.6; landscapes on tripod f/8–f/11 (watch diffraction if you stop down further). • Landscapes: prefer hyperfocal focusing (app/lens scale). If unsure, use f/8–f/11, focus slightly beyond the nearest important subject, and verify with magnified review—avoid the “one-third into the scene” myth. • Macro & close-ups: DoF collapses at close distance—stop down, align the subject with the focus plane, and consider focus stacking for full sharpness. Understanding the fundamental concepts of focus in photography, such as the plane of focus and depth of field, is essential for photographers aiming to enhance their visual storytelling and create compelling compositions. These concepts are intricately linked to how a photographer controls what appears sharp in an image and what is softened into an out-of-focus blur, effectively directing the viewer's attention. Plane of Focus The plane of focus is a critical concept in photography, referring to the specific area within a scene that is in sharp focus. It can be visualised as an imaginary line or plane that extends across the frame, parallel to the camera's sensor. When a camera lens is focused on a subject, this plane is perfectly sharp, and anything before or after this plane begins to lose sharpness, depending on the aperture setting. For instance, imagine positioning subjects along a straight line in an open field; if they align precisely with this focal plane, they will all appear sharply focused, even at a wide aperture like f1.4. However, if a subject moves slightly forward or backwards away from this line, it will fall out of focus. The width of this plane of focus can be adjusted by changing the aperture: a lower f-stop number (like f1.4) results in a narrower plane, while a higher f-stop number broadens the focus area. Depth of Field Depth of field (DoF) describes the extent of the area in the photograph that appears acceptably sharp. It extends in front of and behind the plane of focus and is influenced by several factors, including aperture size, the distance between the camera and the subject, and the lens’s focal length. Aperture: Smaller apertures (higher f-stop numbers) increase the depth of field, rendering a larger area of the scene in focus. Conversely, larger apertures (smaller f-stop numbers) create a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the plane of focus while blurring the foreground photography and background. Distance to Subject: The closer the subject is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field. Moving the subject away from the camera increases the depth of field. Focal Length: Longer focal lengths reduce the depth of field, making it easier to isolate the subject from distracting backgrounds with a pleasing blur. Shorter focal lengths increase the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus. By mastering these concepts, photographers can manipulate the plane of focus and depth of field to create images that isolate the subject dramatically or include detailed context by keeping the entire scene in sharp focus. Experimentation with these settings allows photographers to achieve their desired artistic effects, whether capturing the intricate details of a portrait or the expansive beauty of a landscape. Autofocus Modes Explained Quick Tips — Autofocus Modes Explained • Pick by motion: AF-S (One-Shot/Single-Shot) for static subjects; AF-C (AI Servo/Continuous AF) for anything moving. • How they behave: AF-S locks focus at half-press; AF-C updates continuously while you track—use burst for action. • Area matters: Single point for precision (eyes, small subjects); expanded/zone for erratic motion; wide/auto with eye/face/animal detect for people and wildlife. • Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: moving the camera changes focus distance. Move the AF point instead (or rely on eye detect) at f/1.4–f/2.8. • Back-button focus (BBF): assign AF to AF-ON. In AF-C, hold to track; release to lock. In AF-S, tap to lock then reframe if DoF allows. • Keep shutter safe: AF-C still needs enough speed to freeze motion (people ~1/250–1/500 s; sport 1/1000–1/2000 s). • Use Manual Focus when AF struggles: very low light, macro, backlit edges, or through glass—enable magnification/peaking for accuracy. • Brand names: Canon One-Shot / AI Servo · Nikon AF-S / AF-C · Sony Single-shot AF / Continuous AF. Understanding the different autofocus modes is crucial for photographers to effectively capture their subjects under varying conditions. Two primary modes dominate most modern cameras: Single-Servo AF (AF-S) and Continuous-Servo AF (AF-C), each serving distinct purposes and scenarios. Single-Servo AF Single-Servo AF, known as AF-S, is ideal for stationary subjects. When the shutter button is half-pressed, the camera focuses once and locks the focus. This mode prevents the focus from changing even if the camera slightly moves, making it perfect for landscapes, still-life, or posed portraits. It's widely used because it allows photographers to recompose their shot after focusing, ensuring the subject remains sharply in focus despite any repositioning of the frame. For instance, in Canon systems, this is referred to as One-Shot AF, while Sony labels it Single-Shot AF. Continuous-Servo AF Continuous-Servo AF, or AF-C, is designed for moving subjects. It continuously adjusts the focus as long as the shutter button is half-pressed, tracking the subject's movement across the frame. This mode is essential for sports, wildlife, or any dynamic scene where the subject is in constant motion. The camera predicts the subject's next position to maintain sharp focus throughout the shooting process. Manufacturers might name this mode differently; Canon calls it AI Servo AF, Nikon as AF-C, and Sony as Continuous AF. Both modes have their specific applications and choosing the right one depends on the nature of the subject and the photographic scenario. For static subjects or when precise focus placement is crucial, AF-S is preferred. Conversely, for capturing action or fast-moving subjects, AF-C offers the responsiveness needed to keep the subject in focus despite rapid movement. Understanding these modes enhances the photographer's ability to handle various shooting environments, ensuring high-quality captures in all conditions. Manual Focus Manual focusing on the camera is a fundamental skill that every photographer should master. By taking control of the focus manually, photographers can ensure that the subject is sharp and crisp in the image. To manually focus, adjust the focusing ring on the lens until the subject appears sharp in the viewfinder or on the camera's LCD screen. This technique is especially useful in low-light situations or when the camera's autofocus struggles to lock onto the subject. Practice and patience are key to mastering manual focusing, but the results are well worth the effort, allowing photographers to have full control over their compositions. Autofocus Area Modes Explained Quick Tips — Autofocus AREA Modes Explained • Single-Point AF: absolute precision—place the point on the eye/critical detail. Best for portraits, product, macro, landscapes. Avoid focus-recompose at f/1.4–f/2.8—move the point instead. • Expanded / Small Zone (a.k.a. 5-point, 9-point, “Expand”): you aim the centre, nearby assist points help if the subject drifts. Great for children, casual movement, perched birds. • Dynamic / Tracking (hold-to-track): you start with one point; camera follows subject if it moves. Good for erratic motion (dance, dogs). Tune tracking sensitivity/lock-on in menu to match subject behaviour. • Zone / Large Zone: a cluster (left/centre/right or custom). Use when subjects move within a region (team sports in one third of the frame). Aim the zone at the group, not the background. • Wide / Auto Area: camera decides the focus point(s). Fast for grab-shots, but can pick the wrong subject—improve reliability by enabling subject detection (people/animal/bird). • Face/Eye/Animal/Bird Detect (AI subject recognition): uses on-sensor PDAF with recognition models. Best in AF-C when the face/eye is visible. Limit detection to the subject type you’re shooting to prevent false locks. • 3D Tracking / Subject-Tracking AF (brand-specific): colour/pattern-aware tracking that follows your chosen subject anywhere in the frame. Start with a precise point on the target, then half-press/AF-ON to let it roam. • Back-Button Focus (BBF): assign AF to AF-ON so you can keep the area active while decoupling it from the shutter—tap to acquire, hold to track, release to lock. • Practical picks: static headshot → Single-Point on the nearest eye; kids/pets → Expanded + Eye Detect; field sport → Zone/3D + AF-C; birds-in-flight → Wide + Bird Detect or Dynamic/3D if detect fails. • Avoid misses: lower contrast or small eyes? increase point size (Expanded); cluttered background? use tighter area (Single/Small Zone); backlit edges? switch to subject detect off and aim the point manually. Names vary: Canon (One-Shot/AI Servo; Spot/1-Point/Expand/Zone/Whole Area), Nikon (AF-S/AF-C; Single/Pinpoint/Dynamic/Wide/3D), Sony (AF-S/AF-C; Flexible Spot/Expand/Zone/Wide, Eye/Subject Detect). Auto focus area mode in photography allows the photographer to select the specific area in the frame where they want the camera to focus. This feature is particularly useful when capturing subjects that are off-center or when there are multiple subjects at different distances in the frame. By choosing the autofocus area mode, photographers can ensure that the camera focuses exactly where they want it to, resulting in sharper images with the intended subject in clear focus. Different cameras offer various autofocus area modes, such as single-point AF, zone AF, and wide AF, giving photographers the flexibility to adapt to different shooting scenarios and achieve desired results. Single Point Area Mode The user selects the specific focus point to use by aligning it to their subject Dynamic Area Mode The user selects the specific focus point but if the selected subject moves the camera adjusts the focal point used to the moving subject Auto Area Mode The camera selects the specific focus point based on what it thinks is the subject! Eye or AI Area Mode The camera automatically recognises the subject, human, eye, animal and so on and quickly focuses appropriately. This new recognition technology is improving all the time. Techniques for Achieving Perfect FocusFocus and Recompose The technique of focus and recompose is particularly useful when photographers face limitations with autofocus points, especially in low-light conditions where the lens may struggle to find focus. By setting the camera to Single Servo (AF-S) mode, one can ensure the focus is acquired once and maintained, even when recomposing the shot. This method involves focusing on the subject with a half-press of the shutter button, then while keeping the button half-pressed, the camera is moved to reframe the shot. It's crucial, however, to be cautious with this technique when using wide apertures or shooting at close distances, as the focus plane shifts and could lead to a defocused subject. Back-Button Focus Back-button focusing separates the tasks of focusing and shutter release, allowing photographers greater control, particularly in dynamic environments. By assigning the autofocus activation to a button on the back of the camera, such as the AF-On button, the photographer can focus with the thumb and shoot with the index finger independently. This setup is ideal for action photography where subjects move unpredictably, such as in sports or wildlife photography. For instance, during a football game, a photographer can keep the focus on an athlete by holding the back button and capture the perfect moment without worrying about refocusing due to any intervening players or objects. Focus Stacking Focus stacking is a sophisticated technique used to extend depth of field in photography. This method is particularly beneficial when dealing with macro photography or any scenes requiring front-to-back sharpness. It involves taking multiple photos at different focus distances and blending them to create a single image with greater depth of field than any single shot could achieve. Using a tripod is essential to maintain consistent framing across shots, and manual focus is recommended to adjust the focus precisely for each shot. After capturing the necessary images, software like Photoshop can be used to align and blend these layers effectively, ensuring a sharp composite image across the entire frame. By mastering these techniques, photographers can tackle various focusing challenges and enhance the sharpness and clarity of their images, regardless of the shooting conditions or subject matter. Common Focusing Challenges and Solutions Quick Tips — Common Focusing Challenges & Solutions • Give AF more light: use a lens with a wider max aperture; open up to aid AF (then stop down for the shot if DoF allows). • Raise ISO to keep speed: faster shutter reduces viewfinder shake so AF locks more reliably. • Enable AF-assist / torch: use the camera’s AF-assist lamp or briefly light the subject to create contrast. • Your lock-and-kill trick: place a lit object where you want the focus plane, acquire focus, switch to MF without moving, remove the object, shoot. • Manual focus aids: magnified live view + focus peaking; use a tripod for precision. • Use bigger areas if needed: switch from tiny spot to small/expanded point to avoid hunting on featureless subjects. Fast-Moving Subjects • AF-C + subject detect: continuous AF with Eye/Face/Animal/Bird detect when available. • Right area mode: Zone / 3D / Tracking for erratic motion; Expanded point for predictable paths; avoid tiny spot for speed. • Tune tracking: increase “responsiveness/lock-on” for abrupt direction changes; decrease to ignore brief obstructions. • Shutter speed first: people ~1/250–1/500 s; field sport ~1/1000–1/2000 s; BIF ~1/2000–1/4000 s. • Pre-focus & pan: focus where action will enter; pan smoothly through; use Back-Button Focus and high-speed burst. • Lens helpers: set the focus-limiter to the expected distance range to stop hunting. General Safeguards • Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: move the AF point (or use eye detect) instead of focus-recompose at f/1.4–f/2.8. • Stabilise: IBIS/VR tames hand shake (not subject motion). Use support when speeds drop. • Review critically: zoom to 100% on the eye/leading edge; adjust point size/area if you see repeated misses. Low light conditions can significantly impact the effectiveness of autofocus systems, often leading to blurry or out-of-focus images. To combat this, photographers can employ several strategies to enhance focusing accuracy: Use a Lens with a Wider Maximum Aperture: A lower f-number allows more light to enter the camera, aiding the autofocus system in low light situations. Increase ISO Sensitivity: Boosting the ISO makes the camera more responsive to light, albeit at the risk of increased noise or grain in the images. Enable Built-In Focus Assist Light: Many cameras come equipped with a focus assist light that helps the autofocus system by illuminating the subject. Switch to Manual Focus: In scenarios where autofocus continually struggles, manually focusing the lens ensures control over the sharpness and clarity of the subject. Place a lit subject in the scene where you want the focal plane/DoF to start - lock focus on it, then switch to manual focus without changing anything -else. Remove the lit object, phone, torch or whatever you used to lock focus on and take your picture. Fast Moving Subjects Focusing on fast-moving subjects presents another set of challenges as the autofocus system may fail to maintain a lock on the subject, especially when it moves rapidly across the frame. The following techniques can improve focus accuracy for dynamic subjects: Use High-Speed Continuous Autofocus Mode: This mode is better equipped to track and maintain focus on moving subjects. Adjust Autofocus Sensitivity and Speed: Increasing these settings can enhance the camera's responsiveness, making it quicker to adjust focus as the subject moves. Pan with the Subject: Matching the camera's movement with the subject's speed and direction helps maintain focus by keeping the subject in a consistent position within the frame. Anticipate the Subject's Movement: Focusing on the area where the subject is expected to move allows the photographer to capture the subject sharply as it enters the pre-focused zone. By understanding and applying these solutions, photographers can address common focusing challenges effectively, ensuring sharp and clear images even in demanding shooting conditions. ✓ Do — Habits for Consistently Sharp Focus • Match AF to motion: AF-S for static; AF-C for anything moving. • Pick the right area: Single-point for precision; Expanded/Zone for movement; 3D/Tracking for erratic motion. • Use subject detect wisely: enable Eye/Face/Animal/Bird and limit to the subject type you’re shooting. • Aim at critical detail: nearest eye for people; leading edge for wildlife/sport; align the plane of focus to the subject. • Back-Button Focus (BBF): assign AF to AF-ON; hold to track, release to lock. • Keep a safe shutter: ≈1/(2× focal length) for static; people 1/250–1/500s; sport 1/1000–1/2000s; BIF 1/2000–1/4000s. • Set DoF deliberately: stop down when you need more depth; use hyperfocal for landscapes; consider focus stacking for macro. • Use lens helpers: focus limiter to stop hunting; pre-focus to expected distance; tune tracking responsiveness. • Calibrate & update: AF micro-adjust (DSLR) or check mount tolerances; keep body/lens firmware current. • Verify and iterate: burst for action, review at 100% on the eye/edge, adjust point size/area if you see repeated misses. ✗ Don’t — Common Focus Killers • Don’t focus-recompose at f/1.4–f/2.8—move the AF point instead (or use eye detect). • Don’t use a tiny point for fast/erratic subjects—choose Expanded/Zone/Tracking. • Don’t rely on IBIS to freeze subjects—raise shutter; IS only tames your shake. • Don’t trust LCD brightness as proof of sharpness—zoom in and check the eye/edge. • Don’t leave detect on the wrong type (e.g., Human when shooting birds)—it will mis-prioritise. • Don’t forget minimum focus distance—step back or switch to a macro-capable lens. • Don’t block AF-assist or shoot through grime—aim at a contrast edge or clean the surface. • Don’t AF on featureless areas—create contrast (torch/phone), then lock focus and switch to MF. • Don’t let shutter drift below safe limits—raise ISO or open aperture instead of accepting blur. • Don’t stack contrast-killing filters in low light—remove extras (e.g., cheap UV) to help AF lock. Editing Tips — Focus • Software can’t rescue missed focus: if the focal plane is in the wrong place or motion blur is heavy, you can only improve perceived sharpness slightly. Aim for tack-sharp capture first. • Correct in the right order: lens profile → WB → exposure/contrast → then noise reduction → sharpening. Sharpening before NR amplifies noise and artifacts. • Capture sharpening, masked: small radius (≈0.5–1 px), moderate amount; mask to edges so flat areas (skin/sky) stay smooth. • Selective clarity/texture: add micro-contrast on eyes, lashes, hair, feathers, textures; reduce clarity on skin/background to emphasise the subject. • Use local tools, not global: brush/AI mask the eyes or leading edge; avoid sharpening the whole frame—background noise and halos will rise. • Noise first, then detail: apply luminance NR just enough to quiet shadows; recover bite with masked sharpening. Colour NR for chroma speckling in high ISO files. • Motion/softness triage: mild blur or slight front/back focus may benefit from gentle deconvolution/“deblur,” but push too far and you’ll get crunch/halos. Severe blur: lean into the look (creative motion, B&W) or pick a sharper frame. • Output-aware sharpening: resize for destination, then do final output sharpening (screen vs print). Re-export if the size changes. Rule of thumb: edit to enhance what’s already sharp, not to fix focus errors. If it isn’t sharp in-camera, no amount of sliders will make it truly tack-sharp.

What does focus mean in photography?Focus in photography refers to the area of the image that appears sharpest. It is crucial for drawing attention to a specific object, person, or scene, and is a fundamental aspect of photography alongside ISO, aperture, and shutter speed. Photographers can choose between automatic or manual focusing techniques. 2. What is the general rule for setting focus in photography?When using a wide-angle lens, the focus point should generally be positioned about one-third of the way up from the bottom of the frame. If using a telephoto lens, the focus should typically be on the nearest or most significant element in the frame. 3. What should be the primary focus in a photograph?In portrait photography, the eyes of the subject are usually the most compelling focal point, as they tend to draw the viewer's attention first. This holds true regardless of the aperture setting, unless the artistic intent of the photograph dictates otherwise. 4. What are focus modes in photography?Focus modes in cameras determine whether the camera uses autofocus or manual focus. This setting can often be adjusted using a physical switch marked \"AF/MF\" or through a specific dial and/or button on the camera. 📚 Continue Learning • Next lesson: → What is Depth of Field? → What is Aperture in Photography? → What is Shutter Speed? • Personal support: → Image Reviews Clinic (Zoom, £29) photography-tips, online photography courseAlan Ranger29 May 2025Alan Ranger Photographycamera settings for photography, sharp photos, sharpness”, “focus”, “camera shake”, “tripod”, “shutter speed LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",
