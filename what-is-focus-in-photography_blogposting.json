This lesson explains what focus is (and isn’t), how autofocus modes/areas work, and the simple habits that raise your sharp-hit rate fast. * Mode vs area: AF-S/One-Shot for static; AF-C/AI-Servo for movement. Choose an area that matches your subject size (single point, expanded, zone, wide/auto with eye detection). * Aim the right point: eyes for people, closest eye if angled; leading edge for wildlife/sport; avoid focus-recompose at shallow depth of field. * Technique matters: half-press or back-button focus, burst wisely, and stabilise. Depth of field, subject distance and focal length all affect what looks “in focus”.3 key takeaways 1. Match AF to motion: use continuous AF and an area that covers the subject when anything moves. 2. Prioritise the eye/leading edge: place the active point on the critical detail; don’t rely on recompose at wide apertures. 3. Control the variables: keep shutter high enough for your focal length, stop down when you need more depth, and practice BBF for consistent timing.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS FOCUS IN PHOTOGRAPHYIn the nuanced world of photography, the question of what is focus photography transcends the mere act of h, stop down when you need more depth, and practice BBF for consistent timing.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS FOCUS IN PHOTOGRAPHYIn the nuanced world of photography, the question of what is focus photography transcends the mere act of making subjects look sharp; it is central to the art and science of capturing images that evoke emotion, tell stories, and preserve moments. Mastery of focus—a blend of sharpness, depth of field, and the interplay of focus point photography—empowers photographers to direct viewers' attention effectively within a frame. The ability to manipulate focus photos through autofocus systems, controlling the focal plane, or employing techniques like focus stacking and hyperfocal distance is vital for achieving visual clarity and depth. This critical element determines not just the subjects' clarity but also the photograph's overall impact, making understanding photo focus essential for anyone looking to elevate their photographic work.This article will explore the foundational aspects of focusing in photography, including the significance of focus points, the mechanics of camera focus, and how depth of field contributes to the perception of sharpness. It will delve into autofocus modes, from phase detection autofocus to AF-S, and the practical utilities of focus peaking and focus stacking. Additionally, readers will learn about techniques for achieving perfect focus pictures, overcoming common focusing challenges like \"why won't my camera focus\", and the role of the focus ring, among other focus techniques. By demystifying these concepts, the article aims to arm aspiring object photographers with the knowledge to harness focusing to its full potential, transforming their approach to photography through precision, creativity, and control.THE SCIENCE BEHIND CAMERA FOCUSING: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWTHE BASICS OF CAMERA FOCUSINGAt its core, camera focusing is the process of adjusting the lens to achieve optimal sharpness and clarity for the desired subject or area within the scene. This is accomplished by converging the light rays from the subject onto the camera's image sensor or film plane, resulting in a precisely focused image.WHAT IS CAMERA FOCUSING?Camera focusing is the act of finding the optimal sharpness of an object within the frame. A completely sharp image is said to be in focus, while a blurry or indistinct image is considered out of focus. The focusing mechanism works by adjusting the distance between the lens and the image sensor or film, allowing light to converge precisely at the desired plane.TYPES OF CAMERA-FOCUSING SYSTEMSThere are several types of focusing systems employed in cameras: 1. Split-Image Rangefinder: This system displays two images of the subject, which align and merge when the subject is in focus. 2. Matte Field: A matte surface within the viewfinder aids in quick shooting and low-light situations. 3. Microprism Ring: This system consists of numerous tiny prisms and is useful for focusing on subjects lacking distinct vertical elements. 4. Phase Detection Autofocus: Found in modern DSLR cameras, this system uses a dedicated autofocus sensor to detect and achieve focus by analysing the phase differences between light rays. 5. Contrast Detection Autofocus: Common in mirrorless cameras and live view modes, this system analyses the image’s contrast on the primary sensor to determine and adjust focu ystem uses a dedicated autofocus sensor to detect and achieve focus by analysing the phase differences between light rays. 5. Contrast Detection Autofocus: Common in mirrorless cameras and live view modes, this system analyses the image’s contrast on the primary sensor to determine and adjust focus.----------------------------------------HOW AUTOFOCUS WORKS IN MODERN CAMERASTHE SCIENCE BEHIND CAMERA FOCUSING — QUICK REFERENCEFocusing moves lens elements so light converges on the sensor at the chosen plane of focus. Below are the main focusing systems and how modern autofocus (AF) methods differ.System / Aid How it works Strengths Limitations Best use Split-image rangefinder (manual aid) Two half-images align when focus is correct. Very precise on defined edges/lines. Struggles in low light/low contrast; slows shooting. Manual focus lenses; static subjects. Matte field (manual aid) Ground-glass texture shows peak sharpness. Good general manual focusing feedback. Harder at very wide apertures or dim scenes. Manual focusing, tripod work. Microprism ring (manual aid) Tiny prisms shimmer when out of focus. Quick visual cue for rough focus. Less precise; can sparkle in low contrast. Fast manual focus on mid-contrast subjects. Phase-detection AF Splits light into pairs; measures phase difference to know direction & amount to drive focus. Very fast acquisition; excellent subject tracking. Can misfocus in very low light or low contrast; requires calibration on some DSLR bodies. Sport, wildlife, people in motion. (DSLR: dedicated AF module; mirrorless: on-sensor PDAF.) Contrast-detection AF Analyzes image contrast on the main sensor; peaks at max contrast = sharpest focus. Very precise for static subjects; no AF calibration needed. Slower “hunt”; weaker for moving subjects. Tripod, product, macro, landscapes; live view. Hybrid AF Combines PDAF speed with contrast AF fine-tune (often on-sensor). Fast and accurate; best all-round performance. Can still slow in very dim/low-contrast scenes. Modern mirrorless for most subjects; eye/face/animal AF.AUTOFOCUS METHODS — AT A GLANCEAF method Speed Precision (static) Tracking (moving) Low light / low contrast Notes / best practice Phase-detect ★★★★★ ★★★★☆ ★★★★★ ★★★☆☆ Use AF-C/servo with subject-appropriate area; micro-adjust (DSLR) if needed. Contrast-detect ★★★☆☆ ★★★★★ ★★☆☆☆ ★★★☆☆ Best on tripod/static scenes; use magnified view/peaking for precision. Hybrid (on-sensor) ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ Enable eye/face/animal detect; choose zone that fits subject size; refine with contrast AF if needed.Note: Many modern mirrorless cameras use on-sensor phase detection (PDAF) alongside contrast AF for hybrid performance.Modern cameras employ two primary autofocus (AF) systems: phase detection and contrast detection. These systems work in tandem to provide accurate and efficient focusing capabilities.PHASE DETECTIONPhase detection AF is a hardware-based system that uses an array of microlenses to split incoming light into pairs of images. By measuring the distance between these image pairs, the camera can determine whether the subject is front or back-focused. This information is then used to instruct the lens on how to adjust its focus accurately.The phase detection system works as follows: 1. Light enters the lens and is partially reflected by the primary mirror onto a dedicated AF sensor. 2. Microlenses on the AF sensor divide the light into pairs of images for each active AF point truct the lens on how to adjust its focus accurately.The phase detection system works as follows: 1. Light enters the lens and is partially reflected by the primary mirror onto a dedicated AF sensor. 2. Microlenses on the AF sensor divide the light into pairs of images for each active AF point. 3. The separation between these image pairs is analysed to calculate the required degree and direction of focus adjustment. 4. The camera instructs the lens to move its focus ring accordingly until the subject is perfectly sharp.Phase detection AF is swift and precise, making it ideal for tracking moving subjects in sports or wildlife photography.CONTRAST DETECTIONContrast detection AF relies on software algorithms to analyse the contrast levels within the image captured by the camera's main sensor. The system scans the scene, rapidly adjusting the lens focus until the highest contrast (sharpest detail) is achieved for the desired subject.While contrast detection AF is generally slower than phase detection, it offers superior accuracy for stationary subjects. It works by: 1. Evaluating the contrast levels across the image sensor. 2. Adjust the lens focus incrementally while monitoring contrast changes. 3. Locking focus when the maximum contrast is detected, indicating optimal sharpness.HYBRID SYSTEMSMany modern cameras combine phase detection and contrast detection AF into a hybrid system, leveraging the strengths of both technologies. This approach allows for fast and accurate focusing in various shooting scenarios.Hybrid AF systems can switch between phase detection for quick subject acquisition and contrast detection for precise fine-tuning. Some advanced implementations combine data from both systems simultaneously, resulting in exceptional autofocus performance.By understanding how these autofocus systems operate, photographers can better utilise their camera's capabilities and capture sharper, more compelling images.----------------------------------------BASIC CONCEPTS OF FOCUSQUICK TIPS — PLANE OF FOCUS & DEPTH OF FIELD * Plane of focus: the razor-sharp slice where light converges on the sensor. At wide apertures (e.g., f/1.4–f/2) it’s thin—place it on the critical detail (eyes for people, leading edge for wildlife). * Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: moving the camera changes focus distance. Move the AF point to the subject instead; use eye/face detect when reliable. * Three levers for DoF: aperture (smaller opening → more DoF), distance (farther → more DoF), focal length (shorter → more DoF). Use them together to get the look you want. * Practical starts: headshots f/2–f/2.8; couples f/2.8–f/4; small groups f/4–f/5.6; landscapes on tripod f/8–f/11 (watch diffraction if you stop down further). * Landscapes: prefer hyperfocal focusing (app/lens scale). If unsure, use f/8–f/11, focus slightly beyond the nearest important subject, and verify with magnified review—avoid the “one-third into the scene” myth. * Macro & close-ups: DoF collapses at close distance—stop down, align the subject with the focus plane, and consider focus stacking for full sharpness.Understanding the fundamental concepts of focus in photography, such as the plane of focus and depth of field, is essential for photographers aiming to enhance their visual storytelling and create compelling compositions. These concepts are intricately linked to how a photographer controls what appears sharp in an image and what is softened i cus in photography, such as the plane of focus and depth of field, is essential for photographers aiming to enhance their visual storytelling and create compelling compositions. These concepts are intricately linked to how a photographer controls what appears sharp in an image and what is softened into an out-of-focus blur, effectively directing the viewer's attention.PLANE OF FOCUSThe plane of focus is a critical concept in photography, referring to the specific area within a scene that is in sharp focus. It can be visualised as an imaginary line or plane that extends across the frame, parallel to the camera's sensor. When a camera lens is focused on a subject, this plane is perfectly sharp, and anything before or after this plane begins to lose sharpness, depending on the aperture setting.For instance, imagine positioning subjects along a straight line in an open field; if they align precisely with this focal plane, they will all appear sharply focused, even at a wide aperture like f1.4. However, if a subject moves slightly forward or backwards away from this line, it will fall out of focus. The width of this plane of focus can be adjusted by changing the aperture: a lower f-stop number (like f1.4) results in a narrower plane, while a higher f-stop number broadens the focus area.DEPTH OF FIELDDepth of field (DoF) describes the extent of the area in the photograph that appears acceptably sharp. It extends in front of and behind the plane of focus and is influenced by several factors, including aperture size, the distance between the camera and the subject, and the lens’s focal length. * Aperture: Smaller apertures (higher f-stop numbers) increase the depth of field, rendering a larger area of the scene in focus. Conversely, larger apertures (smaller f-stop numbers) create a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the plane of focus while blurring the foreground photography and background. * Distance to Subject: The closer the subject is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field. Moving the subject away from the camera increases the depth of field. * Focal Length: Longer focal lengths reduce the depth of field, making it easier to isolate the subject from distracting backgrounds with a pleasing blur. Shorter focal lengths increase the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus.By mastering these concepts, photographers can manipulate the plane of focus and depth of field to create images that isolate the subject dramatically or include detailed context by keeping the entire scene in sharp focus. Experimentation with these settings allows photographers to achieve their desired artistic effects, whether capturing the intricate details of a portrait or the expansive beauty of a landscape.----------------------------------------AUTOFOCUS MODES EXPLAINEDQUICK TIPS — AUTOFOCUS MODES EXPLAINED * Pick by motion: AF-S (One-Shot/Single-Shot) for static subjects; AF-C (AI Servo/Continuous AF) for anything moving. * How they behave: AF-S locks focus at half-press; AF-C updates continuously while you track—use burst for action. * Area matters: Single point for precision (eyes, small subjects); expanded/zone for erratic motion; wide/auto with eye/face/animal detect for people and wildlife. * Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: moving the camera changes focus distance. Move the AF point instead (or rely on eye detect) at f/1.4–f/2.8. * Back-button focus (BB",
