WHETHER YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL OR AN AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER, HAVING THE RIGHT FILTERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY. ONE BRAND THAT HAS GAINED RECOGNITION FOR ITS INNOVATIVE FILTER SYSTEMS IS KASE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE WILL EXPLORE THE ADVANTAGES AND FEATURES OF “REVOLUTION “ KASE FILTERS, INCLUDING THEIR INLAID RING DESIGN, COMPATIBILITY, AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE. LET'S DIVE IN AND DISCOVER HOW THESE FILTERS CAN REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE.UNDERSTANDING PHOTOGRAPHIC FILTERSBefore delving into the specifics of Kase Revolution filters, let's briefly discuss the importance of photographic filters. Filters are transparent accessories that are attached to the front of a camera lens to modify or control the light entering the camera. They can enhance colors, reduce glare, and adjust exposure levels, resulting in more vibrant and visually appealing images. Two popular types of filters are Neutral Density (ND) filters and Polarizers.NEUTRAL DENSITY (ND) FILTERSNeutral Density filters are designed to reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing for longer exposure times without overexposing the image. They are invaluable for landscape photographers who want to capture smooth, flowing waterfalls or create motion blur in their images. D) FILTERSNeutral Density filters are designed to reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing for longer exposure times without overexposing the image. They are invaluable for landscape photographers who want to capture smooth, flowing waterfalls or create motion blur in their images. ND filters come in various strengths, indicated by the number of stops they reduce the light, such as ND8 (3 stops) or ND64 (6 stops).View fullsizePOLARIZERSPolarizing filters help eliminate reflections and glare from non-metallic surfaces, such as water, wet surfaces or glass. They can deepen the blue sky, make clouds more prominent, and enhance colour saturation. Polarizers are particularly useful in landscape and outdoor photography, where they can significantly improve the overall image quality and exposure. For woodland photography, they are a must for me, helping to remove reflective highlights from all those random leaf surfaces.View fullsize----------------------------------------INTRODUCING KASE REVOLUTION FILTERSKase Filters have gained attention in the photography community for their unique design and outstanding performance. These filters offer several key features that differentiate them from conventional filter systems. Let's take a closer look at what makes Kase Revolution Filters stand out.INLAID RING DESIGNOne of the most notable features of Kase Filters is their inlaid ring design. Unlike conventional filters that fit on top of the lens ring, the inlaid ring sits inside the lens's filter thread. This design allows the filters to sit closer to the lens's front element, reducing the chances of vignetting and ensuring optimal image quality.View fullsizeCOMPATIBILITY AND SIZE OPTIONSKase Filters come in three thread sizes: 77mm, 82mm, and 95mm, making them compatible with a wide range of lenses. The filters are available in both Entry-Level Kits and Pro Kits, catering to photographers with varying needs. The Entry-Level Kits include essential filters such as polarizers and ND filters (ND8 and ND64), while the Pro Kits add an ND1000 filter (10 stops) for more advanced long-exposure photography.COLOUR-CODED FILTER RIMSKase Revolution Filters feature colour-coded filter rims to make it easier for photographers to distinguish between different filters. The polarizer has a silver rim, the ND8 has a blue rim, the ND64 has a gold rim, and the ND1000 (exclusive to the Pro Kits) has a red rim. This colour-coding system lets photographers quickly identify the desired filter, saving time and ensuring a smooth workflow.View fullsizeCONVENIENT ACCESSORIESKase Revolution Filters come with several convenient accessories that enhance the overall user experience. The filters include magnetic lens caps, which provide a secure and hassle-free way to protect the filters when not in use. Additionally, the filters, adapter rings, and lens cap can be neatly stored and carried in the provided grey fabric carry case, which features a belt loop and brass clip for easy transport.View fullsizeADVANTAGES OF KASE REVOLUTION FILTERSNow that we have explored the key features of Kase Revolution Filters, let's discuss their advantages over conventional filter systems.CLOSER FILTER PLACEMENT AND REDUCED VIGNETTINGThe inlaid ring design of Kase Revolution Filters allows the filters to sit closer to the lens's front element. This closer placement minimizes the chances of vignetting, especially with lenses cuss their advantages over conventional filter systems.CLOSER FILTER PLACEMENT AND REDUCED VIGNETTINGThe inlaid ring design of Kase Revolution Filters allows the filters to sit closer to the lens's front element. This closer placement minimizes the chances of vignetting, especially with lenses that require slim filters. By reducing vignetting, photographers can capture images with maximum clarity and avoid unwanted dark corners or edges in their shots.SEAMLESS STACKING OF FILTERSKase Revolution Filters make it easy to stack multiple filters, allowing photographers to combine different effects and achieve their desired creative vision. With the magnetic attachment system, photographers can stack polarizers and ND filters without any hassle, enabling them to control light and exposure precisely.HIGH-QUALITY OPTICS AND IMAGE PERFORMANCEOne crucial aspect of any filter system is its impact on image quality. Kase Revolution Filters excel in this regard, providing exceptional optical quality and ensuring minimal distortion or color shifts. These filters are designed to deliver accurate and true-to-life colours, allowing photographers to capture images with stunning clarity and detail.USER-FRIENDLY DESIGN AND EASY INSTALLATIONInstalling and removing filters should be seamless, and Kase Revolution Filters deliver on this front. The magnetic attachment system allows for quick and secure filter attachment, saving photographers valuable time in the field. However, it's worth noting that removing filters with a lens hood in place can be challenging, as the magnets are strong and the filters are thin. It is recommended to remove the lens hood before taking off the filters or to use the filters without a lens hood if possible.View fullsizeKase FiltersOVERCOMING LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTWhile Kase Revolution Filters offer numerous advantages, there are a few limitations and areas for improvement worth mentioning.NO GRADUATED NEUTRAL DENSITY (GND) FILTERSOne limitation of Kase Revolution Filters is the absence of graduated neutral density (GND) filters. GND filters are traditionally used to balance exposure between the sky and the foreground in landscape photography. As Kase Revolution Filters have a circular design, it is not possible to create GND filters for this system. Photographers who heavily rely on GND filters may find this limitation to be a drawback and may need to explore alternative filter solutions. Or do as I do and bracket exposures.CHALLENGES WITH LENS CAPS AND FILTER REMOVALThe magnetic lens caps provided with Kase Revolution Filters offer a sleek and compact alternative to standard lens caps. However, removing the lens cap can be challenging, especially when a lens hood is in place. It would be beneficial if the lens caps had a small handle or clasp in the middle, allowing for easier removal without the need to take off the lens hood. Additionally, photographers wearing thick winter gloves might find it challenging to remove the filters due to the strong magnets and thin design.CONCLUSIONPhotographic filters play a vital role in enhancing the creative possibilities of photography. Kase Revolution Filters offer a unique and innovative solution for photographers looking to elevate their images. With their inlaid ring design, compatibility, and overall performance, these filters provide photographers with the tools they need to capture stunning and visually captivating sh raphy.
