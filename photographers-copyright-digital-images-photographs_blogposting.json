It covers pretty much everything so worth reading and implementing a copyright notice on your website if you have one or at least knowing the legal position if you find your images being copyright infringed. There's a lot of misinformation, myth and even paranoia regarding photo copyright so hopefully this will dispel and clarify some key points for you. Copyright notice: digital images, photographs and the internet There are several websites that now provide a scanning service to discover if your images have been used, without your permission. It may take some time for them to scan and match infringements and generally they are only interested in a legal case on your behalf if the infringement for commercial or business use. If they find commercial infringement they will take the case on your behalf and deduct a service fee from any royalty/usage fee they receive from the offender. news, photography-tipsAlan Ranger28 January 2018Alan Ranger Photographynews, copyright LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",
