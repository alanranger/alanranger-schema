Use aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set shutter speed to capture a bird in flight. 2. Set your camera to shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set aperture to photograph a running deer. 3. Capture a close-up shot of a resting animal using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed to create a blurred background. 4. Photograph a group of animals interacting using shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze the action. 5. Use aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed to photograph a landscape with wildlife, ensuring both the subject and background are in focus. 6. Set shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a bird landing on a branch, letting the camera adjust the aperture.💡 Stretch Tasks * Experiment with long exposure techniques using a tripod to capture wildlife moving through a scene at dusk, while maintaining ISO 200. * Create a series of images that document the behavior of a specific animal over a period, focusing on different times of day and settings.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do be patient and wait for the right moment to capture wildlife. * ✓ Do use a tripod to stabilize your shots, especially in low-light conditions. * ✓ Do respect wildlife and maintain a safe distance to avoid disturbing them. * ✓ Do familiarize yourself with local wildlife laws and regulations regarding photography. * ✓ Do keep your gear ready and accessible for spontaneous opportunities.DON'T * ✗ Don't approach wildlife too closely, as it may stress or scare them away. * ✗ Don't use flash photography, as it can startle animals and disrupt their natural behavior. * ✗ Don't forget to check your camera settings before shooting. * ✗ Don't ignore the background in your compositions; it can make or break your shot. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take your time to observe and compose.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What challenges did you face while trying to photograph wildlife, and how did you overcome them? * How did using priority modes change the way you approached shooting wildlife? * What did you learn about animal behavior that helped you capture better images? * How can you improve your patience and observa lenges did you face while trying to photograph wildlife, and how did you overcome them? * How did using priority modes change the way you approached shooting wildlife? * What did you learn about animal behavior that helped you capture better images? * How can you improve your patience and observational skills for future wildlife photography sessions?For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

Students will learn to effectively capture the beauty of natural environments while employing specific techniques to enhance their images.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the importance of light in landscape photography and how to use it to create mood. * Develop compositional skills that emphasize the natural environment and tell a story. * Practice using camera settings effectively in priority modes to achieve desired artistic effects.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a natural landscape location that inspires you, such as a park, beach, or mountain. * Check the weather forecast to identify optimal lighting conditions (golden hour or blue hour). * Plan your shoot time to coincide with the best light conditions. * Pack essential gear including a tripod, wide-angle lens, and filters. * Charge your camera batteries and ensure you have enough memory cards for the s forecast to identify optimal lighting conditions (golden hour or blue hour). * Plan your shoot time to coincide with the best light conditions. * Pack essential gear including a tripod, wide-angle lens, and filters. * Charge your camera batteries and ensure you have enough memory cards for the session.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field, setting it at f/8 for sharpness across the landscape. * Utilize fixed ISO 200 to minimize noise while letting the camera adjust shutter speed as needed. * Experiment with long exposures for water or cloud movement by using a tripod and a neutral density filter. * Bracketing exposures can help capture a range of highlights and shadows in dynamic lighting. * Consider using a polarizing filter to enhance colors and reduce glare in your landscape shots.CREATIVE FOCUS * Incorporate leading lines in your composition to guide the viewer's eye through the image. * Use foreground elements to add depth and scale to your landscape photographs. * Anchor your composition with a clear focal point that draws attention. * Experiment with different angles and perspectives to find unique compositions. * Capture the landscape at various times of day to explore how light changes the scene.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Visit a local natural park during golden hour, using aperture priority mode set at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, and capture at least three different compositions focusing on leading lines. 2. Choose a water body, use shutter priority mode set at 1/4s with ISO 200 fixed, and create a long exposure shot to capture the smooth movement of the water. 3. Find a viewpoint that showcases a vast landscape, using aperture priority mode set at f/11 with ISO 200 fixed, to ensure maximum depth of field. 4. Take a series of images at different times of day in the same location to observe how the light affects the landscape, using aperture priority mode throughout. 5. Select a scene with dramatic clouds and use shutter priority mode set at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze the motion of the clouds. 6. Create a composition that includes both a foreground element and a distant background, using aperture priority mode set at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed to balance focus throughout the scene.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a high dynamic range (HDR) image by taking multiple exposures at different settings, using a tripod to maintain composition. * Shoot a panorama of a wide landscape scene, ensuring to overlap images by about a third for a seamless blend.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do plan your shoots around the best lighting conditions for landscape photography. * ✓ Do use a tripod to stabilize your camera for longer exposures. * ✓ Do experiment with different compositions and perspectives to find your unique style. * ✓ Do keep the natural environment as the main focus of your landscape images. * ✓ Do shoot in RAW format to retain maximum detail for post-processing.DON'T * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose your images carefully. * ✗ Don't ignore the weather conditions as they can dramatically change the mood of your photographs. * ✗ Don't forget to check your camera settings before starting to shoot. * ✗ Don't include man-made objects in your landscape images if they distract from the natural scene. * ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's auto mode; practice using priority modes for better creative control.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did check your camera settings before starting to shoot. * ✗ Don't include man-made objects in your landscape images if they distract from the natural scene. * ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's auto mode; practice using priority modes for better creative control.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did the natural light conditions influence your landscape photographs? * What compositional techniques worked best in your images, and why? * Reflect on a challenging shot: what did you learn about your approach to landscape photography? * How does the use of foreground elements change the perception of depth in your photos?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → Mastering Landscape Photography Tips And Techniques * → Finding Your Compositional Balance For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

Participants will learn to manipulate camera settings to achieve desired motion effects while maintaining control over the exposure.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the principles of movement and intentional blur in photography. * Master the technique of using long exposure to capture dynamic scenes. * Experiment with different methods of camera movement to create artistic effects.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a location with sufficient light and movement, such as a busy street or a flowing river. * Gather necessary equipment including a tripod, ND filters, and a remote shutter release. * Plan the time of day for shooting, ideally during golden hour or twilight for softer light. * Familiarize yourself with your camera settings, especially priority modes. * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 to ma necessary equipment including a tripod, ND filters, and a remote shutter release. * Plan the time of day for shooting, ideally during golden hour or twilight for softer light. * Familiarize yourself with your camera settings, especially priority modes. * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 to maintain consistency during the shoot.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use shutter priority mode to control shutter speed while allowing ISO and aperture to adjust automatically. * Experiment with different shutter speeds to see how they affect the motion captured in your images. * Ensure the camera is stable on a tripod to prevent unintended camera shake. * Use ND filters to extend exposure times even in bright conditions. * Lock focus on a stationary object to maintain clarity in parts of your frame.CREATIVE FOCUS * Try intentional camera movement (ICM) techniques by moving the camera in different directions while the shutter is open. * Capture light trails by panning the camera horizontally during exposure. * Experiment with zooming in and out while the shutter is open to create dynamic effects. * Incorporate foreground elements that remain static while capturing motion in the background. * Use the blur to convey a sense of speed or emotion in your photographs.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use shutter priority mode at 1/2s with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust aperture, and capture flowing water to create smooth blur effects. 2. Set up a scene with moving traffic, use shutter priority mode at 1/30s with ISO 200 fixed, and capture the streaks of light from cars to illustrate motion. 3. Choose a busy public space and practice ICM by moving the camera vertically while using shutter priority mode at 1/4s with ISO 200 fixed. 4. Use shutter priority mode at 1/15s with ISO 200 fixed to capture people walking through a park, creating a ghosting effect. 5. At sunset, set your camera to shutter priority mode at 1s with ISO 200 fixed, and photograph clouds moving across the sky to create dramatic streaks. 6. Set up your camera on a tripod at a busy intersection, use shutter priority mode at 1/8s with ISO 200 fixed, and pan with a moving subject like a cyclist.💡 Stretch Tasks * Experiment with shooting multiple long exposures and layering them in post-processing to create complex movement compositions. * Create a time-lapse sequence by combining multiple long exposure shots taken in succession to showcase movement over time.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do use ND filters to enable longer exposures in bright conditions. * ✓ Do practice panning techniques to achieve intentional blur with moving subjects. * ✓ Do experiment with different shutter speeds to find the best effect for your scene. * ✓ Do maintain a stable setup with a tripod to ensure clarity in static elements. * ✓ Do review your histogram to ensure proper exposure while using long exposure techniques.DON'T * ✗ Don't hold the camera by hand when using long exposure; always use a tripod. * ✗ Don't forget to lock focus on a stationary element to contrast with motion. * ✗ Don't use automatic mode; always use priority settings to maintain control over exposure. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take the time to experiment with different movements. * ✗ Don't ignore the effects of light; consider the time of day and weather conditions before shooting.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did different shutter speeds affect the perception of movement in your images? * * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take the time to experiment with different movements. * ✗ Don't ignore the effects of light; consider the time of day and weather conditions before shooting.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did different shutter speeds affect the perception of movement in your images? * What challenges did you face while attempting intentional camera movement, and how did you overcome them? * In what ways did using ND filters enhance your ability to capture movement? * How do you think the sense of motion in your photos impacts the viewer's emotional response?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → How To Take Long Exposure Photos For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

Roll the dice to determine your travel distance and direction. For example, if you roll a 4 (kilometers), 2 (miles), and 6 (east), set your camera to f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode and travel 4 kilometers east, photographing anything that catches your eye. 2. Once at your destination, switch to f/8, 1/125s, ISO 400 in manual mode, and capture a series of 5 images focusing on textures and patterns you encounter within a 10-meter radius. 3. After completing the first round, roll the dice again and travel to a new location. Use f/2.8, 1/60s, ISO 800 in shutter priority mode to capture the ambiance of the new setting during golden hour. 4. Choose one of your photos from the previous tasks and create a diptych with another image taken from a different angle or perspective. Set your camera to f/4, 1/125s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode to capture the second image in natural light. 5. Invite a friend to join you for the next round of dice rolling. Roll the dice together to determine your new destination and use f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 400 in manual mode to capture candid moments of each other exploring the area. 6. Create a small photo essay (3-5 images) based on a theme discovered during your explorations. Use f/8, 1/125s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode to maintain consistency across your images.💡 Stretch Tasks * Explore a location at night and utilize long exposure techniques with settings of f/11, 10s, ISO 100 in manual mode to capture light trails or star patterns. * Create a collage of your favorite images from the assignment and present them in a digital format, ensuring each image has a consistent editing style.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do embrace spontaneity and allow the dice to guide your exploration. * ✓ Do take notes on your experiences and the settings used for each photograph. * ✓ Do share your images with others to gain feedback and insights. * ✓ Do experiment with different compositions and perspectives.

By practicing with these techniques, you'll learn how to effectively lead the viewer’s attention to your subject.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Identify and utilize leading lines to create depth in images. * Experiment with different shapes and geometric patterns in various environments. * Understand how to compose images that direct the viewer's attention effectively.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a location with interesting architectural features or natural landscapes. * Scout for potential leading lines such as roads, pathways, or rivers. * Plan your shooting times to take advantage of natural light, such as golden hour. * Bring a tripod for stability, especially in low-light conditions. * Ensure your camera settings are set to aperture priority mode or shutter priority mode.THE ASSIGNM lines such as roads, pathways, or rivers. * Plan your shooting times to take advantage of natural light, such as golden hour. * Bring a tripod for stability, especially in low-light conditions. * Ensure your camera settings are set to aperture priority mode or shutter priority mode.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed to achieve a wide depth of field. * Utilize shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed to capture moving elements against static lines. * Experiment with different angles to find the most effective lines that lead to your subject. * Pay attention to the framing of your shot; make sure leading lines don’t exit the frame. * Use a wide-angle lens to emphasize leading lines and shapes in your composition.CREATIVE FOCUS * Look for natural curves in your environment, such as river bends or winding paths. * Incorporate man-made elements like fences or roads to create structure in your images. * Experiment with contrasting shapes and lines to create visual interest. * Try to include elements that break the lines or shapes to add dynamics to your composition. * Capture reflections in water or glass to enhance geometric shapes in your photos.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Photograph a pathway or road that leads into the distance, using aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed. 2. Find a building with strong geometric lines and capture it from a low angle, using shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed. 3. Explore a park and photograph different shapes created by trees, paths, or benches, utilizing aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. 4. Capture the curves of a river or road, ensuring the lines lead towards your subject, using shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed. 5. Identify and photograph a fence or wall with leading lines that guide the viewer to a focal point, using aperture priority mode at f/11 with ISO 200 fixed. 6. Take a photo of an intersection or crossroads where multiple lines converge, using shutter priority mode at 1/125s with ISO 200 fixed.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of images focusing on different types of leading lines (curved, straight, diagonal) and present them as a cohesive portfolio. * Challenge yourself to find and photograph a location using only geometric shapes, avoiding organic lines and curves.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do look for lines that naturally lead to your subject. * ✓ Do vary your perspective to discover unique leading lines. * ✓ Do ensure your composition is balanced when using strong geometric shapes. * ✓ Do experiment with both wide and tight framing to see how it affects the leading lines. * ✓ Do review your images post-shoot to analyze how effectively the lines guide the viewer's eye.DON'T * ✗ Don't let leading lines exit the frame, as this can distract from the subject. * ✗ Don't use cluttered backgrounds that may confuse the viewer’s eye. * ✗ Don't ignore the foreground; include elements that enhance the leading lines. * ✗ Don't shoot from eye level only; vary your height for more dynamic perspectives. * ✗ Don't forget to check your composition before pressing the shutter.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did the use of leading lines impact the viewer's eye movement in your images? * What challenges did you face when trying to incorporate shapes and geometry in your compositions? * In what ways did different perspectives change the effectivene re pressing the shutter.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did the use of leading lines impact the viewer's eye movement in your images? * What challenges did you face when trying to incorporate shapes and geometry in your compositions? * In what ways did different perspectives change the effectiveness of leading lines? * How does the choice of aperture or shutter speed affect the depth and clarity of the leading lines in your photos?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Are Leading Lines In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

      "articleBody": "SHADOWS AND CONTRAST PHOTOGRAPHY PRACTICE ASSIGNMENThttps://www.alanranger.com/free-online-photography-courseSHADOWS AND CONTRASTIn photography, shadows and contrast are powerful tools that enhance the depth and drama of an image. By skillfully manipulating light and shadow, photographers can create striking compositions that evoke emotion and intrigue.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the role of shadows in creating contrast and mood in photography. * Master the technical aspects of capturing shadows effectively using various camera settings. * Explore creative techniques to use shadows and contrast for compelling visual storytelling.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Scout locations with varying light conditions and interesting shadow patterns. * Prepare your camera by ensuring it is charged and has sufficient memory space. * Choose the right lens for your desired composition, such as a wide-angle for landscapes or a prime lens for portraits. * Set your camera to manual mode for maximum control over exposure settings. * Check the weather forecast to plan for optimal natural lighting conditions. ficient memory space. * Choose the right lens for your desired composition, such as a wide-angle for landscapes or a prime lens for portraits. * Set your camera to manual mode for maximum control over exposure settings. * Check the weather forecast to plan for optimal natural lighting conditions.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use a low aperture (f/2.8) to create a shallow depth of field, isolating shadows and enhancing contrast against the background. * Set your shutter speed to 1/250s to freeze motion and capture sharp details in both shadows and highlights. * Adjust your ISO to 200 for bright daylight conditions to minimize noise while maintaining image quality. * Utilize spot metering to focus on the light and shadow areas, ensuring proper exposure for contrast. * Set your white balance to 'Shade' to warm up the tones in shadowed areas, enhancing their richness.CREATIVE FOCUS * Experiment with backlighting to create silhouettes, using shadows to define shapes and forms. * Incorporate leading lines created by shadows to draw the viewer's eye into the composition. * Use shadows to create patterns and textures, adding depth and interest to your photographs. * Capture reflections of shadows in water or glass surfaces to create a layered effect. * Play with the angle of light to manipulate the length and intensity of shadows for dramatic effects.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Photograph a subject in direct sunlight at f/4, 1/125s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode, focusing on the shadows cast by the subject. 2. Capture a scene during golden hour at f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 200 in manual mode, emphasizing the contrast between warm light and long shadows. 3. Shoot a close-up of an object with a strong shadow at f/2.8, 1/250s, ISO 400 in shutter priority mode, ensuring the shadow details are crisp. 4. Create a silhouette against a sunset at f/8, 1/500s, ISO 100 in manual mode, focusing on the subject's outline and the vibrant colors in the background. 5. Photograph an urban scene with harsh midday sun at f/11, 1/1000s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode, capturing the stark contrast between light and shadow on buildings. 6. Experiment with flash to create dramatic shadows at f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 800 in manual mode, adjusting the flash power to control shadow intensity.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of black and white images focusing on shadows and contrast, using a consistent camera setting of f/4, 1/125s, ISO 200 in manual mode. * Develop a photo essay that tells a story through shadows, capturing a variety of techniques and settings in a cohesive narrative.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do explore different times of day to see how shadows change with the angle of light. * ✓ Do use reflectors to bounce light into shadowed areas for balanced exposure. * ✓ Do experiment with different lenses to capture shadows from unique perspectives. * ✓ Do analyze your images post-shoot to understand how shadows and contrast affect the overall composition. * ✓ Do share your shadow photography with peers for feedback and discussion.DON'T * ✗ Don't ignore the background; distracting elements can detract from the impact of shadows. * ✗ Don't rely solely on automatic settings; take control for more creative results. * ✗ Don't forget to adjust your settings if the lighting conditions change suddenly. * ✗ Don't overlook the potential of shadows as a subject; they can be as compelling as the main subject. * ✗ Don't shoot in harsh li on't rely solely on automatic settings; take control for more creative results. * ✗ Don't forget to adjust your settings if the lighting conditions change suddenly. * ✗ Don't overlook the potential of shadows as a subject; they can be as compelling as the main subject. * ✗ Don't shoot in harsh light without considering the impact of shadows on your composition.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did manipulating shadows change the mood of your photographs? * What techniques did you find most effective for enhancing contrast? * In what ways did the time of day affect the quality of shadows in your images? * How can you apply the lessons learned about shadows and contrast in future photography projects?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → Mastering The Art Of Shadow Photography * → What Is Contrast In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

By exploring various techniques and settings, photographers will learn how to achieve optimal sharpness and clarity in their images, regardless of the shooting method.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Identify the advantages and disadvantages of handheld shooting versus tripod use. * Understand how shutter speed, aperture, and ISO interact to affect image stability. * Practice specific camera settings to optimize stability in different shooting scenarios.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Ensure your camera is fully charged and memory cards are formatted. * Select a suitable location with varying light conditions to test both methods. * Gather necessary equipment including a tripod, remote shutter release, and lens stabilizer if available. * Familiarize yourself with your camera's settings and ensure you can quickly adjust them. * Plan your com . * Select a suitable location with varying light conditions to test both methods. * Gather necessary equipment including a tripod, remote shutter release, and lens stabilizer if available. * Familiarize yourself with your camera's settings and ensure you can quickly adjust them. * Plan your compositions and consider subjects that highlight the differences in stability.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use a shutter speed of at least 1/(2 × focal length) when shooting handheld to avoid motion blur. * Set your camera to aperture priority mode and use an aperture of f/4 to maintain a good depth of field while allowing enough light. * When using a tripod, experiment with slower shutter speeds (e.g., 1/30s) to capture long exposures without camera shake. * Adjust the ISO to maintain exposure; for tripod shots, you might use ISO 100 to reduce noise. * Utilize manual focus when on a tripod for precise control over your subject, especially in low light.CREATIVE FOCUS * Explore creative compositions by shooting handheld while walking to capture dynamic scenes. * Use a tripod for landscape photography to achieve long exposure effects, such as smooth water or blurred clouds. * Experiment with low angles and unique perspectives when shooting handheld to add interest to your images. * Incorporate motion blur creatively by lowering your shutter speed when handheld, such as 1/15s, while panning with a moving subject. * Try shooting handheld in low light conditions to capture the ambient atmosphere, adjusting settings to f/2.8, 1/60s, ISO 800.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Capture a portrait handheld at f/2.8, 1/100s, ISO 400 in aperture priority mode to test focus accuracy and background blur. 2. Take a landscape shot using a tripod at f/11, 1/30s, ISO 100 to emphasize depth of field and stability. 3. Shoot a moving subject handheld at f/4, 1/500s, ISO 800 in shutter priority mode to freeze the action while testing your grip. 4. Create a long exposure of a waterfall using a tripod at f/16, 2s, ISO 100 to achieve smooth water flow and motion blur. 5. Experiment with handheld shooting at f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 1600 in low light to see how high ISO affects image quality. 6. Capture a night scene using a tripod at f/8, 15s, ISO 200 to create light trails and test the stability of your setup.💡 Stretch Tasks * Photograph a busy street scene with a handheld camera at f/4, 1/250s, ISO 400, then switch to a tripod for the same shot at f/8, 1/8s, ISO 100 to compare results. * Create a time-lapse video using a tripod, setting the camera at f/11, 30s, ISO 100, and adjust exposure settings throughout the shoot to capture changing light.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do check your camera's stabilization settings before shooting handheld. * ✓ Do practice holding your camera with both hands to minimize shake. * ✓ Do use a remote shutter release or timer to avoid camera movement when using a tripod. * ✓ Do explore different angles and heights when using a tripod for more creative compositions. * ✓ Do review and analyze your images post-shoot to assess stability and sharpness.DON'T * ✗ Don't use a shutter speed slower than 1/(2 × focal length) when shooting handheld without stabilization. * ✗ Don't forget to lock your tripod's legs and head to prevent accidental movement. * ✗ Don't shoot in high ISO unnecessarily; use it only when needed to maintain exposure. * ✗ Don't rush your setup; take time to ensure your tripod is stable and secure. shooting handheld without stabilization. * ✗ Don't forget to lock your tripod's legs and head to prevent accidental movement. * ✗ Don't shoot in high ISO unnecessarily; use it only when needed to maintain exposure. * ✗ Don't rush your setup; take time to ensure your tripod is stable and secure. * ✗ Don't overlook the importance of composition; both methods require thoughtful framing.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did the results differ between handheld and tripod shots in terms of sharpness? * What challenges did you encounter while shooting handheld versus on a tripod? * Which method do you find more comfortable and why? * What specific settings did you find most effective for achieving stability in your images?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Shutter Speed * → What Is Shutter Speed For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

By practicing with priority modes, students will learn how to achieve proper exposure while maintaining control over depth of field or motion freeze.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand how to read histograms to assess exposure levels in images. * Learn to use aperture priority or shutter priority modes effectively to control exposure. * Practice evaluating and adjusting settings based on histogram feedback.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Familiarize yourself with your camera's histogram display settings. * Set your camera to either aperture priority or shutter priority mode. * Fix your ISO at 200 to maintain consistent exposure across tasks. * Choose a location with varied lighting to test your exposure skills. * Bring a notebook to record your observations and histogram readings.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Understand the sh rity or shutter priority mode. * Fix your ISO at 200 to maintain consistent exposure across tasks. * Choose a location with varied lighting to test your exposure skills. * Bring a notebook to record your observations and histogram readings.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Understand the shape and distribution of the histogram for optimal exposure. * Learn how to identify clipping in the histogram and its implications. * Practice adjusting exposure compensation based on histogram feedback. * Explore the differences in histograms between images with varied depth of field or motion. * Use the camera’s tools to overlay histogram data while shooting.CREATIVE FOCUS * Experiment with different aperture settings to create varying depth of field while monitoring the histogram. * Use shutter priority mode to capture movement and analyze resulting histogram data. * Incorporate foreground elements to enhance compositional balance while observing exposure. * Try shooting during different times of day to observe how light affects histogram results. * Combine creative framing techniques with exposure adjustments to see their effect on the histogram.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed. Capture a portrait and evaluate the histogram for highlights and shadows. 2. Use shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze action. Photograph a moving subject and assess the histogram to ensure proper exposure. 3. Select a brightly lit outdoor scene and use aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200. Observe the histogram and ensure you're not clipping highlights. 4. In a dimly lit environment, switch to shutter priority mode at 1/60s with ISO 200 fixed. Capture a still life and analyze the histogram for shadow details. 5. Experiment with a backlit subject using aperture priority mode at f/5.6 and ISO 200. Check the histogram to ensure the subject is properly exposed without losing background detail. 6. Take a series of photos in varying lighting conditions using shutter priority at 1/250s with ISO 200. Compare histograms to see how exposure changes with light.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of images focusing on different subjects (e.g., architecture, nature, people) using both priority modes. Analyze and compare how the histogram differs across subjects. * Conduct a low-light photography session using aperture priority mode at f/1.8 with ISO 200. Capture images and assess histograms to adjust your technique based on results.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do check your histogram after each shot to understand exposure. * ✓ Do experiment with different subject distances to see how depth of field affects histograms. * ✓ Do use the exposure compensation feature to adjust for tricky lighting situations. * ✓ Do take notes on your settings and histogram results for each shot to track your progress. * ✓ Do review your images on a computer screen to analyze histogram performance in detail.DON'T * ✗ Don't ignore clipping indicators on the histogram; they can lead to lost details. * ✗ Don't shoot in manual mode for this assignment; focus on priority modes. * ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistency. * ✗ Don't rush through your shots; take time to assess and adjust each image's exposure. * ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's LCD for exposure feedback; always check the histogram.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * H priority modes. * ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistency. * ✗ Don't rush through your shots; take time to assess and adjust each image's exposure. * ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's LCD for exposure feedback; always check the histogram.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did your understanding of exposure change after using the histogram? * What challenges did you encounter while trying to achieve proper exposure with priority modes? * In what scenarios did you find the histogram particularly helpful or confusing? * How might you apply the lessons learned about histograms in future photography projects?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography * → Exposure Bracketing A Guide For Photographers For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

By practicing specific tasks, you'll gain confidence in capturing sharp images of both static and moving subjects.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the difference between autofocus modes and when to use them * Develop skills in tracking moving subjects with appropriate focus settings * Learn to prioritize focus points to achieve sharp images in various scenariosWANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Familiarize yourself with your camera's autofocus settings and modes * Select a suitable location with dynamic subjects (e.g., people, wildlife, sports) * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 for consistent exposure * Ensure your lens is clean to avoid distortion in your images * Practice locating and selecting focus points manually on your cameraTHE ASSIGNMENTTECHNI a suitable location with dynamic subjects (e.g., people, wildlife, sports) * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 for consistent exposure * Ensure your lens is clean to avoid distortion in your images * Practice locating and selecting focus points manually on your cameraTHE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use AF-C (Continuous AF) mode when photographing moving subjects * Select a single point focus area for precise control over your focus point * Utilize back-button focus for better timing and to avoid focus-recomposing errors * Maintain a shutter speed fast enough to freeze motion based on your focal length * Experiment with different focus area settings (e.g., zone, expanded) based on subject sizeCREATIVE FOCUS * Capture portraits by focusing on the subject's closest eye for sharpness * Try to anticipate the movement of your subject and pre-focus on expected points of action * Play with depth of field by using aperture priority to isolate your subject from the background * Use leading lines to direct attention towards your focused subject in the composition * Experiment with different angles and distances to find unique perspectives on your subjectsASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a moving subject like a cyclist or a pet in action. 2. Set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, and photograph a portrait, ensuring to focus on the nearest eye. 3. In a crowded area, use AF-C mode with a single point focus to track a moving child playing in the park. 4. Practice using back-button focus while shooting a bird in flight, utilizing shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed. 5. Find a subject with repetitive movement (like a dancer) and use aperture priority at f/4 with ISO 200 to capture sharp images while blurring the background. 6. Set your camera to AF-C mode and photograph a car driving by using shutter priority at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, ensuring to keep the leading edge of the car in focus.💡 Stretch Tasks * Challenge yourself to capture a sports event using a zone focus area setting to track multiple players in motion. * Create a series of images with varying depth of field while focusing on the same subject, switching between different aperture settings.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do match your autofocus mode to your subject's movement (AF-C for moving subjects). * ✓ Do prioritize the eye as the focus point when photographing people. * ✓ Do practice using different focus areas to see which works best for various subjects. * ✓ Do keep your camera steady using a tripod or stabilizing techniques, especially at slower shutter speeds. * ✓ Do review your images after shooting to assess focus accuracy and make adjustments for next time.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely on focus-recompose techniques when using wide apertures, as this can lead to missed focus. * ✗ Don't use AF-S mode for subjects that are in motion, as it will not track them effectively. * ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistent exposure. * ✗ Don't forget to check your focus point before taking a shot, especially in crowded scenes. * ✗ Don't shoot without considering your shutter speed relative to your focal length to avoid motion blur.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did changing autofocus modes affect your ability to capture sharp images of moving subjects? * What challenges did you face when trying to focus on the nearest eye ✗ Don't shoot without considering your shutter speed relative to your focal length to avoid motion blur.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did changing autofocus modes affect your ability to capture sharp images of moving subjects? * What challenges did you face when trying to focus on the nearest eye during portrait photography? * In what scenarios did you find back-button focus to be particularly useful or challenging? * How does depth of field influence the way you compose your shots, especially with moving subjects?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Focus In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

Using Aperture Priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, photograph a bright outdoor scene and use Matrix metering to capture a well-exposed image. 2. Switch to Centre-weighted metering and take a portrait shot in natural light, ensuring the subject is correctly exposed while the background is slightly darker. 3. Find a scene with harsh lighting contrasts, such as backlit subjects, and use Spot metering to focus on the subject's face, adjusting the exposure as necessary. 4. Photograph a snowy landscape using Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, applying +1 to +2 EV exposure compensation to avoid underexposure. 5. Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, and use Spot metering to capture a subject in motion against a bright background, ensuring correct exposure. 6. Use Aperture Priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, photograph a scene at dusk using Centre-weighted metering, and then check the histogram for highlight warnings.💡 Stretch Tasks * Shoot a series of images using all three metering modes in various lighting conditions, comparing the results to see which mode performs best for each situation. * Create a portfolio of images that showcase the impact of exposure compensation adjustments on your photographs.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do practice switching between metering modes based on the scene. * ✓ Do use exposure compensation to correct for tricky lighting conditions. * ✓ Do verify your exposure using the histogram after each shot. * ✓ Do take notes on how different metering modes affect your images. * ✓ Do experiment with both Aperture and Shutter Priority modes to see their effects on exposure.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely solely on Matrix metering for all scenes without considering the subject. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of exposure compensation in high contrast situations. * ✗ Don't forget to check your histogram for clipping after taking a shot. * ✗ Don't switch to Manual mode unless you are fully confident in your exposure settings. * ✗ Don't assume the camera's metering will always provide the correct exposure without adjustments.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does the choice of metering mode influence the mood of your photographs? * What challenges did you face when using Spot metering, and how did you overcome them? * In what situations did you find Centre-weighted metering most effect rrect exposure without adjustments.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does the choice of metering mode influence the mood of your photographs? * What challenges did you face when using Spot metering, and how did you overcome them? * In what situations did you find Centre-weighted metering most effective, and why? * How can you apply your understanding of metering modes to improve your future photography?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Metering In Photography * → Exposure Bracketing A Guide For Photographers * → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

By experimenting with different f-numbers and compositions, students will learn to control what appears sharp and what remains blurred, enhancing storytelling through their photographs.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the relationship between aperture settings and depth of field. * Learn to isolate subjects using shallow depth of field. * Master techniques for achieving deep depth of field in landscape photography.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a subject that can benefit from either shallow or deep depth of field. * Select a location with varied backgrounds to test depth of field effects. * Ensure your camera is set to Aperture Priority mode (A/Av) or Shutter Priority mode (S/Tv). * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200. * Bring a tripod for stable shots when using slower shutter speeds.THE ASSIGNMENTTE Select a location with varied backgrounds to test depth of field effects. * Ensure your camera is set to Aperture Priority mode (A/Av) or Shutter Priority mode (S/Tv). * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200. * Bring a tripod for stable shots when using slower shutter speeds.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use a wide aperture (e.g., f/2.8) to create shallow depth of field for portraits. * Utilize a narrow aperture (e.g., f/16) for landscapes to achieve maximum sharpness. * Experiment with different focal lengths to see how they affect depth of field. * Focus on the nearest eye when capturing portraits to ensure sharpness. * For landscapes, focus slightly beyond the nearest detail for optimal depth.CREATIVE FOCUS * Try to tell a story through selective focus by isolating key elements in your composition. * Incorporate foreground elements to enhance depth when using shallow depth of field. * Vary your angles and perspectives to see how they influence depth of field. * Create a series of images with varying depth of field for a cohesive narrative. * Use depth of field to guide the viewer's eye towards the main subject.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed to photograph a portrait, focusing on the subject's eyes while blurring the background. 2. Set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/16 with ISO 200 fixed and capture a landscape scene to achieve sharpness from foreground to background. 3. Experiment with different focal lengths by taking the same portrait at f/2.8 and f/4 while changing your distance from the subject. 4. Use shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a moving subject, allowing the camera to set the aperture for optimal depth of field. 5. Shoot a close-up of a flower using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, ensuring the background is softly blurred. 6. Capture an image of a street scene at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed for a balanced exposure.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a diptych showcasing the same scene with both shallow and deep depth of field effects, using aperture priority mode for both. * Challenge yourself to use hyperfocal distance principles in a landscape shot by setting your aperture to f/11 with ISO 200 fixed.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do experiment with different aperture settings to see their effects on depth of field. * ✓ Do focus on the most important element in your composition to ensure it remains sharp. * ✓ Do use a tripod for landscape shots to avoid camera shake at slower shutter speeds. * ✓ Do review your images to analyze how different depths of field affect your storytelling. * ✓ Do practice switching between aperture and shutter priority modes to see how they influence your creative choices.DON'T * ✗ Don't use manual mode with all settings specified; focus on priority modes instead. * ✗ Don't forget to check your background for distractions that may affect your depth of field. * ✗ Don't assume that shallow depth of field is always better; consider the context of your subject. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose and adjust settings for optimal results. * ✗ Don't limit yourself to one type of subject; explore various scenes to understand depth of field.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does manipulating aperture change the story you can tell with your images? * In what situations do you find shallow depth of field most effective? r optimal results. * ✗ Don't limit yourself to one type of subject; explore various scenes to understand depth of field.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does manipulating aperture change the story you can tell with your images? * In what situations do you find shallow depth of field most effective? * What challenges did you encounter when trying to achieve deep depth of field? * How does the choice of focal length influence your depth of field outcomes?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Depth Of Field * → What Is Aperture In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.

      "articleBody": "BEST TRIPOD FOR LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY BENRO MAMMOTH + GD36PTTable of Contents ShowINTROTripods are one of the most important tools for landscape photography – and one of the easiest to overlook. A good set of legs and a reliable head can make the difference between sharp, confident images and a frustrating session of soft or slightly misaligned frames. I am often asked by clients what I recommend as the best tripod for landscape photography.I’ve written before about my experiences comparing different support systems in my Gitzo vs Benro tripod review . This time, Benro asked me to test a newer combination for landscape work: * Benro Mammoth TMTH44C carbon-fibre tripod * Benro GD36PT hybrid geared headI’ve been using them alongside my long-term Benro setup: * Benro GD3WH Precision Geared Head * Benro Combination C3770TN Series 3 Carbon tripodAs landscape photographers, we’re all looking for reliable tripods for photography, and this combination is a strong contender, especially for stability, low shooting positions, and precise composition.This review focuses on how the Mammoth + GD36PT perform in real landscape conditions, and whether they genuinely belong in the conversation for the best tripods for landscape photography – especially if you already own older Benro legs or the GD3WH. If you’re just starting your tripod research, see my guide on the best lightweight travel GD36PT perform in real landscape conditions, and whether they genuinely belong in the conversation for the best tripods for landscape photography – especially if you already own older Benro legs or the GD3WH.

WHAT I LOOK FOR IN A LANDSCAPE TRIPODFor the kind of landscape work I do – seascapes, woodland, long exposures and changeable light – my tripod needs to: * Stay rock solid in wind and on uneven ground * Reach a comfortable eye-level height without a centre column * Go very low for foreground-driven compositions * Handle heavier lenses with a good safety margin * Allow precise composition without constant fiddlingI’ll use that lens to compare the heads and legs.TRIPOD HEAD COMPARISON – BENRO GD36PT VS GD3WHHow the newer hybrid geared head compares to my long-term GD3WH for landscape photography.Feature / Spec Benro GD36PT Benro GD3WH Head type Hybrid ball + geared head Pure 3-way geared head Geared control Pitch & roll geared; panning free-moving Full geared control on all 3 axes Movement range Small geared range; larger moves via ball Wide geared range on each axis Load capacity Approx. 6 kg Approx. 6 kg Weight ≈ 690 g ≈ 870 g Quick release Arca clamp with supplied spacer Arca clamp Typical UK price £279–£329 £165–£195 Video references YouTube: GD36PT overview & demo YouTube: Benro geared head in use WHAT “HYBRID GEARED” ACTUALLY MEANSThe GD36PT is described as a hybrid ball + geared head. In practice that means: * You use the ball to make big moves quickly – for example, swinging from portrait to landscape or re-aiming to a new composition. * Once you’re close, you use the geared knobs on pitch and roll to nudge the framing by small, precise increments.So you get some of the speed of a ball head with much of the precision of a geared head, which is very appealing for landscape photography where horizons and fine adjustments matter.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeThe trade-off is that not every axis is geared. Panning (yaw) is still a free-moving, non-geared rotation at the base, whereas on the GD3WH every axis is driven by a geared knob. Coming from the older head, I often found my hand reaching for a geared control that simply isn’t there.MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE GD36PT IN THE FIELDI really enjoyed the feel of the geared movement on the GD36PT. It’s smooth, positive and very satisfying when you’re levelling the horizon or lining up foreground elements precisely.However, there are two important limitations to be aware of: 1. Limited geared pitch range You only get a relatively small amount of geared travel forwards and backwards (pitch). To go beyond that, you have to loosen the ball and re-set the head, then come back to the gears for fine tuning. That’s workable, but slower than a full-range geared head when you’re making bigger compositional changes. 2. Snagging on the tripod mounting plate The more serious issue for me is mechanical rather than conceptual. When I pitch the camera further forwards or backwards, the geared controls and housing can physically snag on the top mounting plate of the Mammoth tripod. r compositional changes. 2. Snagging on the tripod mounting plate The more serious issue for me is mechanical rather than conceptual. When I pitch the camera further forwards or backwards, the geared controls and housing can physically snag on the top mounting plate of the Mammoth tripod. The supplied spacer under the head just isn’t quite high enough – it feels like it’s short by about 3 mm – so there isn’t enough clearance between the outer body of the head and the tripod plate.View fullsizeView fullsizeIn normal, near-level shooting positions the head is a pleasure to use. It’s when you push into steeper pitches – which happens often in landscape photography when you’re shooting up a slope or down to foreground rocks – that the snag becomes frustrating.By contrast, the GD3WH doesn’t suffer from this. It’s slower to work with overall, but the full geared range and extra physical clearance mean it feels more predictable when you’re working at the extremes.----------------------------------------3. TRIPOD LEGS COMPARISON – MAMMOTH TMTH44C VS C3770TNTRIPOD LEGS – BENRO MAMMOTH TMTH44C VS C3770TNComparing my long-term Benro legs with the heavier-duty Mammoth for landscape photography.Feature / Spec Benro Mammoth TMTH44C Benro Combination C3770TN Material Carbon fibre Carbon fibre Leg sections 4-section 3-section Max height (no column) ≈ 160 cm ≈ 159 cm Min height ≈ 14 cm (very low) ≈ 38 cm Payload rating Up to 25 kg Up to 18 kg Weight ≈ 2.25 kg ≈ 2.03 kg Levelling / top plate 75 mm bowl levelling platform Flat platform Feet Rubber + spiked feet supplied Rubber feet (spikes optional) Accessory mounts Three 3/8\" accessory threads on apex None Typical UK price £329–£379 £225–£275MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE MAMMOTH TMTH44CI really enjoyed using the Mammoth tripod legs. Out on the coastline, with incoming waves and gusty wind, the whole setup felt solid and reliable. The thicker carbon legs and wide stance inspire confidence; once it’s planted, the tripod doesn’t feel nervous or twitchy.Although it is slightly heavier than my usual C3770TN setup, I was happy with that trade-off for the comfort and stability it gave me. For the way I typically work – often not too far from the car, but on uneven ground – the extra weight felt like a fair price for the way the tripod behaved.The very low minimum height is a real asset. Being able to get the camera down around 14 cm off the ground opens up foreground-driven compositions that simply aren’t possible on taller-minimum systems.The 75 mm bowl also makes levelling for panoramas or precise horizons much quicker. Instead of fighting individual leg lengths, you can get the base level and then fine-tune with the head.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------4. COMBINED SETUP COMPARISON – OLD VS NEW BENRO KITCOMPLETE SETUP – OLD VS NEW BENRO LANDSCAPE TRIPODSHow my long-term GD3WH + C3770TN kit compares to the new Mammoth + GD36PT as a complete tripod for landscape photography.Category Old SetupGD3WH + C3770TN New SetupMammoth TMTH44C + GD36PT Total weight (legs + head) ≈ 2.9 kg ≈ 2.94 kg Max working height ≈ 159 cm ≈ 160 cm Minimum shooting height ≈ 38 cm ≈ 14 cm (much lower) Stability / payload margin Very good (18 kg legs) Excellent (25 kg legs) Head behaviour Full 3-axis geared control, predictable at extremes Hybrid: fast ball + partial gearing t (legs + head) ≈ 2.9 kg ≈ 2.94 kg Max working height ≈ 159 cm ≈ 160 cm Minimum shooting height ≈ 38 cm ≈ 14 cm (much lower) Stability / payload margin Very good (18 kg legs) Excellent (25 kg legs) Head behaviour Full 3-axis geared control, predictable at extremes Hybrid: fast ball + partial gearing, but limited pitch and clearance issues Levelling workflow Leg adjustments only 75 mm bowl for quick base levelling Approx. combined cost (UK) ≈ £390–£470 ≈ £609–£700 Best suited to Budget-conscious, precise composition, lighter loads Demanding landscapes, heavier lenses, low-angle work5. VERDICT – IS THE MAMMOTH + GD36PT THE BEST TRIPOD FOR LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY?Putting it all together: * As a set of legs, the Benro Mammoth TMTH44C is outstanding. For landscape photography it ticks almost every box: stability, height, very low shooting positions, and a bowl that makes levelling fast. I’d happily call it one of the best tripods for landscape photography in its class, especially for serious users who aren’t counting every gram. * As a head, the Benro GD36PT is a more nuanced story. The hybrid concept works well and the geared motion is lovely to use within its range, but the limited pitch movement and the snagging on the tripod mounting plate mean it doesn’t fully replace my GD3WH for more extreme compositions.If you’re building or upgrading a serious tripod for landscape photography, my honest conclusion would be: * ✅ Mammoth TMTH44C – highly recommended * ⚖️ GD36PT – good within limits, but I’d like a taller spacer and more geared range * 💡 GD3WH – still excellent when you need full-range geared control🛒 WHERE TO BUY * Benro UK – GD36PT 3-Way Geared Head: → https://uk.benroeu.com/benro-gd36pt-3-way-geared-head/ * Benro UK – Mammoth TMTH44C Carbon Fibre Tripod: → https://uk.benroeu.com/mammoth-tmth44c-carbon-fibre-tripod/ * Amazon – Mammoth TMTH44C Carbon Fibre Tripod: → https://amzn.to/43vQ4ox * WEX – GD36PT 3-Way Geared Head: → https://wex.pxf.io/dOm04j * WEX – Mammoth TMTH44C Carbon Fibre Tripod: → https://wex.pxf.io/qz73rY Some links on this page may be affiliate links, meaning I may earn a small commission at no cost to you.----------------------------------------6.

The Benro Mammoth is slightly heavier than my older setup, but the extra stability and low shooting height make a noticeable difference in the field.Q: Is a geared head worth it for landscape photography?A: Yes. A geared head allows for precise adjustments to horizon and composition without the “spring-back” of a ball head. The GD36PT is excellent for fine adjustments, but if you frequently shoot at extreme angles, the GD3WH’s full-range gearing may suit you better.----------------------------------------recommended-products Alan Ranger 14 November 2025tripod LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

His panel showed plenty of promise — the overall theme, a key requirement for the Associate level, was solid — but the presentation and consistency in colour and tonal balance were letting it down.We decided to go full “root and branch” and rebuild from the ground up. That meant auditing every image, re-editing from scratch, and developing a completely new body of work. Peter worked tirelessly through the process and, to his credit, took my no-nonsense rejections and critiques squarely on the chin.Along the way, we spent time out in the field for some practical tuition, where I was able to help refine his approach to composition and camera technique — the kind of small but crucial details that make all the difference when the judges’ loupe is out.After several months of re-edits, refinements, and rearranging his panel layout, Peter was finally ready to print. One Vision Imaging, as ever, were superb — offering great support on paper choice and print handling.I’m delighted to say Peter passed his ARPS distinction and joins the growing list of photographers I’ve mentored to RPS success — 18 and counting (4 Associates and 14 Licentiates).His patience, persistence, and good humour — especially during our Lightroom “debates” — made the process a pleasu g.I’m delighted to say Peter passed his ARPS distinction and joins the growing list of photographers I’ve mentored to RPS success — 18 and counting (4 Associates and 14 Licentiates).His patience, persistence, and good humour — especially during our Lightroom “debates” — made the process a pleasure from start to finish.

Understandably, he was frustrated with the process — and the feedback — so he reached out for some honest mentoring and a fresh set of eyes on his failed panel before making one last, all-or-nothing attempt.It didn’t take long to spot the culprits. Many of the images were over-processed, showing halos, noise, and other tell-tale signs that would make any assessor twitch. Technically, that meant the panel was never going to pass — but the raw material was there. John’s visual awareness and range of genres were solid; the problem was more about cohesion. As a set, the images weren’t quite singing from the same hymn sheet.Over three intensive one-hour Zoom sessions, we pulled the whole thing apart and rebuilt it. Re-edits, replacements, and a fair bit of straight-talking later, John emerged with a brand-new panel — this time balanced, polished, and technically tight from corner to corner.The result? Success! John passed his LRPS distinction and gained a deeper understanding of the editing workflow that will no doubt strengthen his already impressive list of photographic accolades.Well done, John — a great result, and a reminder that sometimes less clarity really does bring more clarity. 😉!--- ccess! John passed his LRPS distinction and gained a deeper understanding of the editing workflow that will no doubt strengthen his already impressive list of photographic accolades.Well done, John — a great result, and a reminder that sometimes less clarity really does bring more clarity. 😉!----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JOHN SIMPSON — RPS DISTINCTION SUCCESS STORYDistinction Achieved: LRPSMentor: Alan RangerInterview Date: 12 October 2025Why did you want to gain a distinction with the Royal Photographic Society (RPS)?> I was keen to have recognition of my work from a prestigious photography body.Why did you choose Alan to mentor you for a distinction, and had you worked with him before?> I had not worked with Alan previously. I heard of his reputation by word of mouth and then researched his website and read other people’s reviews.Describe how you found the RPS Mentoring Classes> The format Alan used was very easy to understand and follow. Each session lasted an hour and was very constructive.> The pace was adapted to my level as required. Alan was very patient and answered every question on each aspect of the LRPS criteria.> We carefully worked through my panel in detail together so that some images were replaced and others were altered.> Alan was always at the end of the phone when needed.Did you feel you got the right level of support from the sessions?> Yes, definitely.Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction before starting the mentoring course?> I felt I was good enough to gain the LRPS but had failed on two previous occasions.> It seemed to me that I had not got the right level of post-processing and presentation skills for this award.> Alan advised me to go back to the raw files and re-process them, as my previous panels had been over-processed.> He also recommended re-arranging the images in my panel and changing several.> Going forward, I continue to use Alan’s workflow advice, which I’m enjoying. My images are a lot better for these changes.What distinction did you apply for, and were you successful?> I applied for the LRPS — and yes, I was successful.What was your experience like on the RPS Assessment Day?> I had two RPS assessment days. I didn’t find either very helpful and failed after both, despite following their advice to the letter.> I would not recommend these to anyone. Both sessions lacked detail and depth and were far too superficial.Did you seek independent advice, feedback or input elsewhere before your panel assessment?> I had two sessions with the RPS assessors and failed.> I had three sessions with Alan — and passed.Having completed the course and distinction assessment, what advice would you share with others?> Before starting your journey, submit several images to Alan.> He’ll advise whether they’re good enough, how to approach post-processing, and how to design your panel layout.What was the hardest part of gaining a distinction with the RPS — and why?> The hardest part was trying to unpack what was actually required from the detailed criteria.> It was difficult to understand how some successful panels had met all of them.> I had many award-winning images from other photographic organisations that the RPS assessors were highly critical of — which added to my confusion.Has working towards a distinction helped you progress as a photographer?> Yes, but only because of Alan’s input.> The feedback ad met all of them.> I had many award-winning images from other photographic organisations that the RPS assessors were highly critical of — which added to my confusion.Has working towards a distinction helped you progress as a photographer?> Yes, but only because of Alan’s input.> The feedback from the RPS after each failed assessment was inconsistent and contradictory — which only increased my confusion.Any other comments you’d like to add?> I cannot recommend Alan highly enough — his patience and knowledge are exceptional.> I’m looking forward to working with him again when I consider the ARPS.> Thank you, Alan. I’m very grateful and thrilled to have finally succeeded — I would not have tried again without your guidance.John SimpsonEFIAP, CPAGB, BPE4, LRPS----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining an RPS distinction I can support you with my RPS Courses for distinctions RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * ZOOM - ONLINE * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

These projects will not only help you refine your skills but also empower you to create innovative, fresh images that encapsulate the essence of the season. Each project is crafted to inspire you to think beyond the norm and stretch the boundaries of your creativity.----------------------------------------PROJECT 1: CAPTURING THE SUBTLE DANCE OF LIGHT AND SHADOW * Concept: The first project captures the subtle dance of light and shadow. It involves harnessing the gentle, low-angle sunlight of the autumn season and the captivating interplay of light and shadow in wooded areas or the expansive countryside to craft compelling and dynamic imagery. * Advanced Techniques: * Use side lighting to enhance texture and depth in your images, creating a more three-dimensional feel. * Experiment with exposure bracketing to capture highlight and shadow details, ensuring you don’t lose any essential elements in your composition. * Employ backlighting to create striking rim light effects, especially with dew or frost-covered leaves and foliage. This can add a magical quality to your photographs. * Tips: * Consider using neutral density (ND) filters to extend exposure time when the scene has movement, such as clouds drifting across the sky or water flowing in a stream. * Maximise dynamic range with careful post-processing techniques, such as dodging burning and exposure blending, to bring out the full potential of your images. * Challenge: Push your boundaries by intentionally underexposing your shots to create a more dramatic mood that evokes emotion and intrigueView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT AND AUTUMN REFLECTIONS * Concept: • Dive into the beauty of autumn by creating abstract and painterly images that capture reflections on water. This project invites you to experiment with unique abstract techniques to craft stunning images that evoke the season's essence and inspire viewers. * Advanced Techniques: * Use long exposures (e.g., 1/10 to 1/2 sec) to blur moving water while reflecting vibrant autumn colours. * Look for ripples or light distortion on the water surface to add a unique abstraction layer to the reflection. * Use a polariser filter to adjust the required reflection, contrast or saturation. * Tips: * Adjust shutter speed and exposure to control the degree of blur while preserving recognisable elements like leaves and the water surface to add a unique abstraction layer to the reflection. * Use a polariser filter to adjust the required reflection, contrast or saturation. * Tips: * Adjust shutter speed and exposure to control the degree of blur while preserving recognisable elements like leaves and trees, ensuring your images remain relatable yet artistic. * Select scenes with strong contrasts in colour and texture to enhance the abstract effect of the reflections, allowing the viewer to engage with the image on multiple levels. * Challenge: Combine water reflections with double exposures to create complex, multi-layered autumn compositions that tell a story and invite viewers to explore the depths of your creativity.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------PROJECT 3: USING MIST AND FOG TO CREATE ATMOSPHERIC LAYERS * Concept: Immerse yourself in the enchanting ambience of mist and fog as they gracefully envelop the autumn landscapes. Embrace the art of natural layering to infuse your surroundings with captivating depth and intrigue. * Advanced Techniques: * Position yourself at high points to shoot downwards, allowing the mist to act as a natural diffuser and separate layers of trees, hills, or buildings. * Use long lenses to compress the scene and emphasise the distinct layers fog creates. * Check your exposure and colour balance to ensure you capture a full dynamic range and use the contrast of natural light. * Tips: * Time your shoots for early mornings when mist is most likely to occur. The stillness of dawn often brings the most beautiful fog, wrapping the landscape in a soft embrace. * Focus on low contrast and tonal range in post-processing to enhance the depth and layering effect. Avoid the temptation to adjust the black point too much. Instead, aim for a gentle enhancement that maintains the ethereal quality of the mist. * Challenge: Incorporate human or animal subjects within the mist to add scale and narrative to your images. This can create a powerful connection between the viewer and the scene, inviting them to ponder the story behind the photograph.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------PROJECT 4: MACRO OR CLOSE-UP TEXTURES IN LEAVES AND FUNGI * Concept: Through macro or close-up photography, capture the mesmerising details of decaying autumn leaves, fungi, and other small autumnal elements. Delve into the intricate textures and patterns that adorn these natural marvels, revealing the beauty found in the fleeting moments of the season. * Advanced Techniques: * Use focus stacking to ensure sharpness across intricate textures in close-up shots. This technique allows you to capture the fine details that make each subject unique, from the delicate veins of a leaf to the intricate patterns on a mushroom cap. * Employ off-camera lighting, such as tiny LED lights or reflectors, to highlight your subjects' details and textures. This can help illuminate the natural beauty of your subjects, revealing colours and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. * Ensure you simplify the frame to showcase your subject and make it the main event. Remove any distracting elements from the background to allow the viewer to focus solely on the beauty of the textures. * Tips: * Shoot at smaller apertures (f/8 to f/16) to maximise dep go unnoticed. * Ensure you simplify the frame to showcase your subject and make it the main event. Remove any distracting elements from the background to allow the viewer to focus solely on the beauty of the textures. * Tips: * Shoot at smaller apertures (f/8 to f/16) to maximise depth of field but counteract diffraction with sharpness adjustments in post-processing. * Work with diffused light, such as on cloudy days, to avoid harsh shadows and bring out fine details. Soft light can enhance the textures and colours, making your images more inviting and visually appealing. * Challenge: Look for close-up compositions within natural decay to create images that evoke both beauty and the passage of time. Seek patterns and shapes that tell a story.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize---------------------------------------- PROJECT 5: COLOUR CONTRAST EXPLORATION * Concept: Incorporate bold autumn colours, such as rich oranges, deep reds, and golden yellows, against neutral backgrounds like creams, taupe, and greys to create visually impactful and striking colour contrasts. This will help draw attention to the vibrant autumn hues and make them stand out beautifully. * Advanced Techniques: * Utilise Selective Focus: Use a wide aperture to isolate bold colours against muted backgrounds, creating an intentional contrast that draws the viewer's eye. * Use spot metering to expose the brightest part of the image. Don’t be afraid to underexpose for dramatic impact * Post-Processing Enhancements: Fine-tune colour separation in post-production by selectively adjusting saturation, luminance, and contrast, ensuring that the bold hues stand out against neutral tones effectively. * Tips: * Pay Attention to Backgrounds: Seek out neutral or minimalistic backgrounds without distracting elements to enhance the visual impact of bold autumn colours. * Shoot in Overcast Conditions: Soft, diffused light on cloudy days helps avoid harsh shadows and ensures your colours remain vibrant without distractions. * Challenge: Look for leaves or views where backlighting or directional lighting enhances small sections of scenes and use a long focal length to isolate minor framingView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------CONCLUSION - AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY PROJECTSPrepare to immerse yourself in the captivating splendour of autumn through these autumn photography projects .

      "articleBody": "FREE AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS | EQUIPMENT | APPROACHTable of Contents ShowAUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPSAutumn is a favourite season for many outdoor photographers. The softer light with the sun being lower and the wonderful transition of summer greens to the rainbow of autumn colours makes it an ideal period for any level of photographer to go outdoors and enjoy the environment and make photos that convey their interpretation of this special period. Those interpretations could mean any number of ways to photograph, macro, abstract, close-up or something wider to show more than one element.This autumn photography tips guide is aimed at all those who want to make the most of their outdoor autumn photography adventures over the next 3-4 months. I’ve broken down the preparation required and considerations into several categories to help you plan and maximise each trip you make out with your camera.----------------------------------------HERE ARE MY TOP AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS TO MAKE THE MOST OF THE SEASON#01 TIMING AND WEATHER - AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS * Go out early morning or later afternoon for the softest light when the sun is lower in the sky. * Overcast, even drizzly days are not a write-off, the diffused light will make the colours appear even more saturated * Bright sunny days are good for reflections/shadows and backlit subjects like leaves but the high contrast light can make exposure and good mid-tones difficult to achieve without exposure bracketin izzly days are not a write-off, the diffused light will make the colours appear even more saturated * Bright sunny days are good for reflections/shadows and backlit subjects like leaves but the high contrast light can make exposure and good mid-tones difficult to achieve without exposure bracketing.#02 EQUIPMENT - AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS * A tripod will be essential if you want to do close/macro shots where smaller apertures and/or longer shutter speeds are required * A polarising filter will dramatically reduce the amount of reflected light on shiny surfaces (leaves especially) * Zoom lenses that cover a good range 50mm-200mm will allow you to isolate your subject and zoom in to a specific area of interest. They also allow you to compress the DoF (blur the background) * Use a remote release cable or self-timer to fire the shutter to avoid any camera shake (Remember to turn off image stabilisation if using a tripod) * Take a bin liner to kneel or even lay down on for low down shots and a plastic sandwich bag to cover your camera in drizzle/showers * Take water and snacks and warm clothing - you may be outside for a short period but standing around and becoming cold and hungry/thirsty will impact your energy.#03 OBSERVATION & COMPOSITION - AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS * Spend time evaluating, observing and looking at details and repeat this practice constantly throughout your time on location. For me, 80% of making an image is doing nothing other than observing and considering and only 20% execution. * Move around your subject to view from multiple angles, heights and perspectives. Pay attention to changes, in contrast, colour, texture, background and foreground objects * Don’t get lazy and plonk your tripod down and then use the same lens/settings for every shot. Maybe invest in my viewing frames to encourage you to explore each composition without the restriction of your tripod. * Vary your approach. Macro, abstract, ICM/Movement, Cameo shots - Framing stories, metaphors and essential autumn flavours * What you exclude is often more important than what you include. Discard anything that distracts from your subject matter. Identify your compelling subject and make it the star of the show * Observe the light and pay attention to where it falls on subjects and frame accordingly. Avoid the brightest areas being on the edges of the frame. * Get down low and look at compositions at your feet as well as the obvious brightly coloured trees * Consider how many colours are in the composition, sometimes less is more effective, just two or three colours maximum. * Try to avoid direct sunlight on your subject or shooting into direct sunlight - will create very heavy contrast, reducing colours to shadows and highlights. * Consider the visual weight of all the elements in the image and frame to create a balanced composition - look at opposites, diagonals, vertical and horizontals - are they balanced visually (think of a set of scales) * Think about the foreground, lines, patterns, shapes and direction of how the eye moves through the frame - create a pathway for the eye to follow but don’t just take a shot of a path because its a “leading line” - that won’t cut it in terms of creative thinking.#04 TECHNICAL - AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS * Check your exposure on every shot and re-shoot if needed. Sometimes a bracketed set of exposures is the only way to capture the full d ow but don’t just take a shot of a path because its a “leading line” - that won’t cut it in terms of creative thinking.#04 TECHNICAL - AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS * Check your exposure on every shot and re-shoot if needed. Sometimes a bracketed set of exposures is the only way to capture the full dynamic range of light * Check your depth of field and sharpness/focus point for every shot. Don’t be lazy and just assume you nailed it the first time or the last time. It pays to check it at the time. * Set your white balance to cloudy/shady or do a custom white balance if you want to capture colour accurately. * Vary your metering mode to create a different exposure. Spot metering, for example, on a bright leaf will make everything else in the frame darkerWHY NOT JOIN ME ON ONE OF MY AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOPS AT BATSFORD OR OTHER AREAS AND GET THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE OF THE ABOVE FIRST-HAND.

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHING AUTUMN - UK LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY GUIDETable of Contents ShowIn this blog post, we will explore the breathtaking beauty of autumn landscapes in the UK and provide valuable insights and tips for photographers looking to capture the golden splendour of this season. From the vibrant colours of falling leaves to the misty mornings and dramatic sunsets, the UK offers many opportunities for stunning autumn landscape photography. Photographing autumn is a key highlight in the year for most landscape photographers; however, it does require some preparation to make the most of the season. Autumn photography can be unpredictable regarding when the colours are at their peak. Then, with our seemingly more unpredictable seasonal weather, we must create the time to ensure we can align those windows of opportunity.My workshop schedule is at its busiest period from late September to early December for this very reason, and the weather can sometimes mean postponement, rescheduling and flexibility to meet nature’s timing and working around storms and rain. Autumn 2023 has been one of these years, with warmer temperatures delaying autumn colour and, more recently, torrential levels of rain, causing flooding, disruption, and even a threat to lives in some areas. Several of my events had to be changed over the last 4 weeks for these reasons. However, I have managed to cram an awful lot into the previous six weeks, from the Lake District to Snowdonia, to Dartmoor to Glouces evels of rain, causing flooding, disruption, and even a threat to lives in some areas. Several of my events had to be changed over the last 4 weeks for these reasons. However, I have managed to cram an awful lot into the previous six weeks, from the Lake District to Snowdonia, to Dartmoor to Gloucestershire (for my annual Batsford Arboretum events) to the Peak District and this weekend to the Yorkshire Dales before I return to the Peak District again later this month and finish off the season in Suffolk at the end of this month.It’s been an absolute pleasure meeting new clients throughout this period and welcoming existing clients back. There are still more events for you to join for photographing autumn with me at Batsford if you want personalised support, tuition and experienced location knowledge to make the most of this time of year. Please take a look at my remaining autumn photography workshops. I have made too many images over the last six weeks to include in this post, so show some of my personal favourites so far from this period. You can see all my latest photos here ; there are many more that I have yet to edit and post, so I will add those when time allows. If you can’t make my events or prefer your DIY option, this site is a valuable resource for places that are less rugged and wild. https://www.greatbritishgardens.co.uk/seasonal/autumn-tints.html ----------------------------------------View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------PHOTOGRAPHING AUTUMN: UK LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY GUIDEby Alan Ranger PhotographyAutumn is arguably the most enchanting time of year to capture the beauty of the UK landscape through photography. The vibrant hues of orange, yellow, and red create a spectacle that is hard to resist for any passionate landscape photographer. In this guide to photographing autumn, we will explore some tips and advice to help you make the most of your autumn photography adventures in the UK.Every tree is unique and will be affected by multiple factors of light, soil, temperature, age and more. However, the botanical typical order of the common British woodland species is as follows from earliest to latest.FOUR STAGES OF AUTUMNPHASE 1: GREENThe green leaves you see throughout summer already contain most of the colours of autumn! Throughout most of the year the colours of autumn are ‘covered’ by the dominant green chlorophyll.Chlorophyll helps trees to absorb the energy of the sunlight - the tree is essentially 'charging' during the summer months. Chlorophyll changes carbon dioxide (CO2) + water (H2O) into sugars which 'feed' the tree.Why is chlorophyll green?Chlorophyll is green because it allows trees to absorb blue and yellow wavelengths from the light, but not the green which is reflected back.PHASE 2: TURNING YELLOWAs the weather cools in autumn, the leaves receive less sunlight.Less sunlight triggers chlorophyll to break down (and the tree does not replenish it), revealing the new, colourful pigments underneath and treating us to beautiful autumn yellows and oranges.The yellows and oranges previously masked by chlorophyll are called xanthophylls and carotenoids. These pigments nlight triggers chlorophyll to break down (and the tree does not replenish it), revealing the new, colourful pigments underneath and treating us to beautiful autumn yellows and oranges.The yellows and oranges previously masked by chlorophyll are called xanthophylls and carotenoids. These pigments are present year-round in the leaves but are usually hidden by the green chlorophyll.PHASE 3: FIERY REDSIn some species and in certain special years, you'll see another stage of colour as the leaves turn a vibrant red. This is caused by anthocyanins.These reds are produced in years when lots of sunlight and dry weather have increased the concentration of sugar in tree sap, triggering the tree to release anthocyanins in an attempt to grab the last of the energy from its leaves, powering it up to get through the winter. Interestingly, freezing weather, acidic soils, and other stress factors occasionally trigger the production of higher levels of anthocyanins.PHASE 4: THE FALLAt the end of this colourful process, leaves die. Trees shed their dead leaves because they are no longer able to get energy from them through winter. By shedding their leaves, trees can survive because they make room for new growth in the spring.Trees are great at recycling! Fallen leaves contribute to the health of the forest after they fall, through decomposition. Though the tree has released them, some carbohydrates and sugars remain in the leaves. On the forest floor, these carbohydrates and sugars give nutrition for 'feeders' to flourish. Once fungi and bacteria have begun to break down the leaves, insects get in on the dinner party, too.Once the leaves are broken down, they provide a source of fibre, which helps the soil retain moisture and improve drainage.----------------------------------------SIX TIPS FOR PHOTOGRAPHING AUTUMN1. PLANNING YOUR SHOOTSBefore setting out, it's crucial to plan your shoots in advance. Research locations that are renowned for their autumnal beauty, such as the New Forest, Lake District, Peak District, Wales or Scottish Highlands. Consider the weather conditions, as misty mornings and light rain can add a touch of magic to your photographs. Local photography guides or online resources can provide valuable insights into popular shooting spots and the best times to visit.2. CAPTURING THE COLOURSAutumn landscapes are famous for their stunning display of diverse colours. To make your photographs visually appealing, use a varied range of lens focal lengths to capture expansive scenes adorned with colourful foliage, or isolate your subject in a scene to frame small details and textures, contrast, shapes and light. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to add depth and interest to your compositions. Utilise the soft, warm, and diffused light present during the early morning or late afternoon to enhance the colours even further. Golden hour photography during autumn can produce captivating, ethereal images that will leave a lasting impression.3. USING FILTERS AND ACCESSORIESMaximise the impact of your autumn shots by using filters and accessories to enhance your images. Consider using a polarising filter to deepen the tones and reduce reflective glare, or a neutral density filter to create long exposures of falling leaves or rivers surrounded by autumn foliage. Utilising these tools can bring out the best in your autumn landscape photographs.4. EXPLORING TEXTURES AND PATTERNSAutumn provides an to deepen the tones and reduce reflective glare, or a neutral density filter to create long exposures of falling leaves or rivers surrounded by autumn foliage. Utilising these tools can bring out the best in your autumn landscape photographs.4. EXPLORING TEXTURES AND PATTERNSAutumn provides an abundance of textures and patterns to explore and capture. Look for fallen leaves on the ground, dewdrops on spiderwebs, or reflections in calm waters. These elements add interest and depth to your images, creating a visual feast for the viewer. Be patient, observant, and open to discovering hidden gems within the landscape.5. EMBRACING THE CHANGING LIGHTDuring autumn, the quality and direction of light evolve, creating unique opportunities for photographers. Thick fog, mist, and low sunlight can produce enchanting and moody atmospheres. Embrace these variations in lighting to create a sense of drama and evoke emotions in your viewers. Be constantly observant about the direction of light in your environment and position yourself and your composition accordingly to create images using side light, front light, and backlight. Experiment with the light to design silhouettes or backlit subjects to add a touch of creativity to your autumn captures.6. TELLING A STORYAs with any landscape photography, storytelling is a powerful element that can elevate your images to the next level. Capture the essence of autumn by focusing on the intricate details, such as the fallen leaf on a mossy rock or a lone tree standing against a cloudy sky. Utilise foreground elements and visual pathways to guide the viewer's eye and create a narrative within your frame. Remember, each photograph has a story to tell - make sure yours is captivating.CONCLUSION TO PHOTOGRAPHING AUTUMNAutumn in the UK offers a wealth of opportunities for landscape photographers. By planning your shoots, capturing vibrant colours, utilising filters and accessories, exploring textures and patterns, embracing changing light, and telling a story, you can create breathtaking photographs that capture the essence of this magical season. So grab your camera, venture into the great outdoors, and let the captivating beauty of autumn unfold before your lens.

      "articleBody": "THE WAY OF WU WEI PHILOSOPHY - A PERSONAL REFLECTIONWU WEI PHILOSOPHYOnce upon a time, in the Land of the Middle Kingdom, there lived a great emperor. This mighty lord lived in a magnificent castle, surrounded by many guards, ladies in-waiting, cooks, artists, philosophers, and doctors. He awoke each day to the soft caresses of one of his many wices, ate his breakfast in a wonderful garden surrounded by the morning song of his many birds, and passed his days in the company of his many admirers and flatterers. But he was not happy.He felt he was missing out on some essential thing of life. Just what this essential thing was he did not know, but he knew that he did not have it, and this distressed him endlessly. He filled his court with various magicians and philosophers, all of whom tried to tell him that if he would only listen them and them alone he would find this essential and missing ingredient of his life. But he knew that each was only trying to better his own individual situation, and so did not heed their shining and flattering words.Instead, he winnowed them out, one by one, until there were only two groups left, the Confucians and the Taoists. But he could not decide which of them had the secret and essential thing that he was lacking. The Confucians were a haughty yet wise lot. They did not flatter him in silken phrases like other philosophers had. They told him of the mighty days of old, when the emperor was truly the son of heaven and could in heaven t decide which of them had the secret and essential thing that he was lacking. The Confucians were a haughty yet wise lot. They did not flatter him in silken phrases like other philosophers had. They told him of the mighty days of old, when the emperor was truly the son of heaven and could in heaven’s name. All he had to do was return to those days and revive the ancient ways of the old rites and rituals and his kingdom would prosper - he would be happy and fulfilled, both as a ruler and a man.The Taoists, on the other hand, seemed unorganised and motley crew. They never seemed to agree on anything, even among themselves and spent their days performing strange movements like animals in the garden; their nights drinking wine, reciting poetry, and trying to seduce his ladies-in-waiting. But they were said to have great powers over the elements and the secret of eternal life. Of course, when he questioned them about this they only shrugged and said “we have but once precious secret and the one only, my lord”“well then,” he would say, “What is this precious thing?”“Ah,” they would counter, “We cannot describe this secret in words, great and powerful Lord, we can only show it to you.”“Agreed,” said the emperor, and announced a contest between the Confucians and Taoists. Whichever could show him the true secret of their power, he said, would become the supreme teachers of the land.On the appointed day, the Confucians and Taoists were led to a great chamber deep in the heart of the castle. A great curtain was drawn down the centre of the room, dividing the Taoists from Confucians. Both groups were told that they were to create a painting, a great work of art, on the wall on either side. This would be the final test of their power and knowledge. Whoever impressed the emperor the most would be awarded the prize.The Confucians smiled and quickly ordered all the colours that were available in the royal storerooms. They immediately went to work designing and painting a magnificent mural. The Taoists, on the other hand, ordered a great deal of wine and few dozen soft cloths, the softest that were available. Then they went to work opening the wine.Day after day the Confucians labored on their huge and wondrous mural. Day after day the Taoists ordered more wine and simply rubbed the wall with their soft cloths, over and over, while singing old drinking songs at the top of their lungs.Finally came the day when the emperor would review each work of art and make his decision. First he visited the Confucians’ side of the room, certain that he would be in for a visual treat. He had watched how assiduously the Confucians had applied their layers of colours on the wall and how they stopped often to study the ancient texts and perform slow and stately rituals before taking up their brushes again.He was not disappointed. The Confucians had created a marvel of colour and form. He saw his whole city laid out before him, with his own castle in the very centre of the city, the golden light of the setting sun glinting off its shapely and graceful roofs. At the edge of the painting he saw his own magnificent form astride his favourite war horse, leading his victorious troops into battle against and already vanquished enemy.A great river ran across the bottom of the painting with cunning little waves painted all over it and the curly shadows of birds suspended above it. It was truly a wondrous and amazing sight and the emperor was at a loss as to his victorious troops into battle against and already vanquished enemy.A great river ran across the bottom of the painting with cunning little waves painted all over it and the curly shadows of birds suspended above it. It was truly a wondrous and amazing sight and the emperor was at a loss as to how the Taoists could top it.Imagine his surprise then when he crossed over to the other side of the room to view the Taoists’ work only to find a completely blank wall and a lot of slightly tipsy Taoists doing their strange cloud-like movements. True, the wall was very shiny and smooth after numerous applications with the soft cloths but there was nothing there, no paintings of his magnificence, no golden palace, no wondrous river. “What is this,” he thundered, “you did not even try to paint a picture. Is this the way you curry my favour?”“Oh but we have done our best!” cried the Taoists indignantly, and a little rudely.“But there is nothing there, “ said the emperor, “Is this truly how you view me? Is this your precious secret?”“Wait one moment please,” said the oldest and tipsiest of the Taoists, his long beard still damp with wine. “Please draw the aside the curtain between our walls and you will truly see our work”So shaking his head in wonder, the emperor had the curtain drawn, revealing the dazzling painting of the Confucians. The emperor stood before it once again, marvelling at its wonder(and how they seemed to get his noble brow just so). Then, his mind already made up as to who was the the winner this day, he turned once again to the Taoists’ blank wall, only to find there, not a blank wall after all but the reflection of the painting on the opposite wall. Only this time, instead of a flat and static picture, he saw reflected the unbelievably smooth and shiny wall, a moving picture.Somehow, because of the play of light on the shiny surface there, it seemed as though the painting had come alive. There was the palace and the town again, only he thought he could detect movement behind its windows. The river itself moved, the waves lapping against each other and the birds pirouetting overhead. And lastly, he could see himself there, astride his great stallion, whose very nostrils seemed to quiver in the air while his own beard fluttered in the breeze and his lips seem to move with own shouted ordered to his troops.He was amazed. He was astounded. he turned to the tipsy Taoists and asked them with humility and wonder in his voice just how they had managed this miracle. The Taoists seemed to hang their heads just a little and answered simply.“It is actually in not doing that we achieved this wondrous thing, Sire all we did was create the space for the painting to happen and it painted itself.”“Is this then your precious secret?” asked the great lord.“Yes,” answered the Taoists, “it is indeed.”“We call it Wu Wei”By Solala Towler - Tales from the TAOWu Wei philosophyWu Wei philosophynews , photography-tips , a-journey Alan Ranger 16 September 2025Alan Ranger Photography composition-curiousness composition-curiousness LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "COMPOSITION CURIOUSNESS - PART 1 | PROFESSIONAL GUIDECOMPOSITION - WHY IT MATTERSUndoubtedly the most common question I am asked as a photography tutor, and also the question that probably remains unanswered satisfactorily throughout the life of a photographer is the one around composition. How to, what, why, when and so on... Unlike learning the technical aspects of camera operation and, to a limited extent, the digital dark-room processing operations, the question of composition has always been a topic that attracts debate, opinion and even argument because there is no such thing as definitive guide or instruction manual on how to frame a shot. Those facts therefore should confirm that it can be considered to be purely subjective, purely down to taste and purely down to one person's view over another's. Right? Well to some degree that is true but if it was 100% true then it wouldn't adequately explain why some artists (I include photographers in that label) seem to be able to produce consistently evocative images that seem original whereas others seem to only ever produce imitations of what has been done before or for many reasons produce something that for some reason doesn't quite work or work in the eyes of a judge, a so-called knowledgeable person or someone whose photographic opinion you respect.Given this conundrum, and the fact that a large proportion of my client base is \"beginner\" level I thought it might help to provide some of my own thoughts e reason doesn't quite work or work in the eyes of a judge, a so-called knowledgeable person or someone whose photographic opinion you respect.Given this conundrum, and the fact that a large proportion of my client base is \"beginner\" level I thought it might help to provide some of my own thoughts on the topic in a mini series of blog posts. I do not intend to write a how to guide, or my top ten tips but I will naturally point to what I think are good principles that can be applied by anyone, at any level with any camera. I will share my own thinking, and that of others too, and even use some terms and references that will feel like a framework or dare I say it some \"rules\", but they are not rules in reality, they are considerations, concerns, inquisitiveness, questioning and curiousness into what interpretation the photographer wants to portray in their image.So let's start with the simple truth that we record images for many different reasons, sometimes it's posterity, sometimes documenting an event and sometimes because we have a connection to the subject and want to portray how we feel about it. It's this latter that I want to concentrate this series of posts on. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND THE SUBJECT IS KEY!Some people grab shots as a commodity, a souvenir to take home, a pretty picture, often with themselves in it which I personally really struggle with. The narcissistic plague that we witness each time we go out to beautiful locations demonstrates that these people think they are more important, more significant and obviously more beautiful than the location itself to the extent they place themselves in the centre of the frame so we can be in no doubt that they are of course the center of attention and the main subject! The landscape and environment is there to support them and put them in the spotlight!As it says on the homepage on my website> \"Images are the expression of the photographer; they reflect perception and individuality, portraying a journey through life\"Those types of images suggest to me that those people may be quite egotistical, vain and just possibly a little insecure too, but not likely to be on my Christmas card list (if i actually had one)The image reflects the personality of the photographer, their concerns, interests and relationship with the subject. So without wanting to make this into tips, rules or a how to post I think the first question any photographer should ask themselves before making an image is simply this;WHAT IS MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SUBJECT AND HOW DO I FEEL ABOUT THE SUBJECT?If you can translate those thoughts and feelings into a single word, phrase or something succinct then this could be described as your \"intention\" for making the image.Your intention may be aimed to say something specific or just generally - there are no rights or wrongs in this context just levels of clarity and ambiguity. I am guilty of making many images that really are shots that I think have broad appeal that will work for marketing my business. I know when I make them that they are for that purpose but I still try to inject my own interpretation into them. On other occasions i am in a rare position to make an image that isn't about marketing a workshop, technique or demonstrating something to a client, on those unique moments it definitely feels more free flowing, more ey are for that purpose but I still try to inject my own interpretation into them. On other occasions i am in a rare position to make an image that isn't about marketing a workshop, technique or demonstrating something to a client, on those unique moments it definitely feels more free flowing, more considered and even more frustrating and rewarding in equal measures.One example I have used in beginners photography classes is the child's birthday party. It's a situation that most people experience in life, definitely in childhood but hopefully also in adulthood too as a parent, grandparent, uncle/aunt or other relation.Naturally we want to make images that record moments on this special day and the usual ones are present opening, child enjoying a new toy, child and friends and so on but then of course we get to the formal shot of set moments like cake and candle time.We know it's coming and often when so there really is no excuse for you to be u prepared, caught out and not ready to make an image that captures the magic of that moment. So after several time so using this example to clients in my introductory classes I thought I should probably have an attempt at practising what i had been preaching for a few months.I had lectured about how important it was to close the frame down to the bare ingredients and avoid showing too much in the frame. The image should not show the whole room, every person who was in attendance, the brand or theme of the cake or anything else that may distract from the magic moment of blowing out the candles.My own daughter 7 at the time of this shot, still believed in the wish you got by blowing out the candles so I knew there would be an element of excitement, expectation and belief in her eyes when presented with the cake. On the technical side I knew given her birthday celebration was a day long affair it would be dark by the time we got to do the cake thing so was a little concerned that light would be an issue. (you know how I refuse to use flash). YOU CAN'T CONTROL THE WAVES BUT YOU CAN LEARN TO SURF THEMSo the situation for the shot was; pretty much darkness, no flash, a moving subject and the desire to make an image where I could capture the light in her eyes from the candles and almost see her breath going through the frame onto the flames as they flickered out and she thought of her magic wish and I would only get one chance at the shot.I couldn't control many elements other than my own positioning and doing a few test shots for exposure beforehand. So hand-held, I set the camera to high ISO, continuous burst shooting, continuous focus and wide open aperture.Yep I know it's not perfect and I certainly would wish for less noise in the shot and sharper details on the lips/eyes etc. However, like I said it was a one chance opportunity and as her Dad I was also having to do the lighting and presenting at the same time!I hope I captured some of that magic moment in her eyes, breath as it flowed across the frame into the flickering light!On a subject I am know for more, landscapes, I think the challenges are actually harder to inject your own interpretation and relationship into the shot. We have been brain trained over decades to see and experience in a very literal sense and images generally portray that marked way of presenting a location unless we are prepared to go beyond what we see.\"THE EYE SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN BEFORE IT SEES...\"Those that have attended my cl e shot. We have been brain trained over decades to see and experience in a very literal sense and images generally portray that marked way of presenting a location unless we are prepared to go beyond what we see.\"THE EYE SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN BEFORE IT SEES...\"Those that have attended my classes and workshops will be aware of my mantra about slowing down and spending more time observing than shooting. It's a practise that I just don't encourage but insist on at the start of my workshops. It's not easy to free the mind of the noise of thoughts and emotions that occupy you at any point in time so having made a journey to a location, at whatever distance we travelled, we naturally will have a head still full of stuff that acts as a distraction from being in a \"creative space\".Without wishing to turn this post into a \"mindfulness\" how to, the practise of just observing, clearing your thoughts and concentrating on your subject is really the point here. How well do you know what you are looking at, be it a birch tree or lump of rock? For me, part of the magic of making landscape images is my intimate relationship with it. This has come about by research, study, observation, appreciation and respect of the outdoors world and nature's cycle. That relationship I have with my subject guides how I want to portray it more than how it looks in a literal sense.\"THE EYE ONLY SEES WHAT THE MIND IS PREPARED TO COMPREHEND\"Once you learn and experience how the camera can portray what's in front of it differently to how your eyes experience it then you are armed with some knowledge and choices of how to use that broad range of settings to create an image that conveys your interpretation of the subject.That could be using exposure time to show motion in many forms, slow, frozen or totally unidentifiable subject details. It could be close-up macro with microscopic details or simple use of aperture to create contrasts of what's in focus and out of focus and that's before we get onto the subject of light, shadow, colour, form and texture.These attributes allow us to begin to think about how we use the camera to record our subject, the considerations and the techniques available to us to create the illusion that we have in our mind.Sign up to the blog update subscription to see the next post in this series where I will expand on composition curiousness and share my thoughts on some of the basic principles of space and framing subjects.Please feel welcome to comment and give your opinions and thoughts to this post by adding a comment below.photography-tips Alan Ranger 8 September 2025alan ranger photography composition-curiousness LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 Pinterest0",

Personally, I have always preferred inspiration to information.” Man RayIn my last post on composition composition-curiousness-part-1 I talked about the importance of your relationship to the subject that you are photographing.Part 2 of this series is focused on the importance of the subject versus the technique and tools.It's been three months since I posted the first in this series of journals on composition and since then I have been busy running many workshops both in the UK and more recently in the UAE at the International Festival of Photography where I was commissioned to run a series of masterclasses on composition as well as the advanced camera operation techniques.Whether it was Batsford Arboretum in Gloucestershire or Sharjah in the UAE there was an overriding appetite from participants about \"what makes a good picture?\". Or \"what aperture should I use for this shot?\" and so on...View fullsizePeak District 1 day Photographic WorkshopTHE NEED FOR INFORMATION - COMPOSITIONIt would be easy for me to dismiss these questions as irrelevant and simply tell you that it's simply a case of \"depends\" on what you want to capture, why and how, as I discussed in my last post on comp ew fullsizePeak District 1 day Photographic WorkshopTHE NEED FOR INFORMATION - COMPOSITIONIt would be easy for me to dismiss these questions as irrelevant and simply tell you that it's simply a case of \"depends\" on what you want to capture, why and how, as I discussed in my last post on composition - however when you are starting your own journey into photography clearly you need some pointers and a steer in the right direction. I remember my own early attempts to take a \"serious\" photograph rather than a \"snap\" and I totally gravitated towards the technique and settings more than the subject and narrative. So I get it, I get why this is a real question for beginners and those trying to establish themselves as more than a snapper.So let's deal with that aspect first. Yes having a pointer towards the camera exposure settings will help reinforce your understanding of how to control movement and depth of field in the shot but of course you first need to know the outcome you want before you ask that question. Asking me what exposure settings I would use is of no use to you unless you want to simply replicate my own interpretation and technical execution. I can of course advise someone in terms of maximising sharpness from the lens and depth of field or shutter speed to freeze action or capture movement with blur but those things are easily learnt from a process of trial and error through experimentation by the individual. Which then begs the question are people just simply being lazy or not confident enough to try for themselves and work it out for themselves?View fullsizeBatsford Arboretum photographic workshopI'll let you decide what drives the need for having exact settings and processes called out but I have definitely become less inclined to simply give clients the straight forward answer they seek over the years, I prefer to throw back the question of \"what are you trying to achieve and portray in your image?\" \"THE JOURNEY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DESTINATION ...\"It maybe a hackneyed phrase and the image you seek may also be on similar lines \"clichéd, stock, tired, common, stereotyped, pedestrian, played out, commonplace, worn-out, stale, overworked, banal, run-of-the-mill, threadbare, trite, unoriginal, timeworn and so on but I do understand that just because an image of a \"honeypot\" location has been done countless times or a composition of the same components - trees in mist, long exposure on water over rocks, mirror reflections of mountains on water or any other combination, doesn't mean you shouldn't make a similar image - afterall the reason they have become cliche\" is because they are popular and enjoyed by so many. It's perfectly natural and right, in my opinion, that you should seek and enjoy making those images as part of your journey to becoming a better photographer. At some point in your journey you will decide that those types of images are not enough to feed your appetite and whilst you won't stop making them you will look and explore beyond them.View fullsizelong exposure-howick\"FIRST COMES TOOLS, SECOND COMES INSPIRATION...\"These days that is the opposite way round to the way I work and think, but of course I have 15 years of the journey behind me so you might say that's easy for you to say! I certainly started out on this journey thinking I needed to have the right tools and subsequently acquired \"stuff\" as I went along which in turn motivated me to use it to understand work and think, but of course I have 15 years of the journey behind me so you might say that's easy for you to say! I certainly started out on this journey thinking I needed to have the right tools and subsequently acquired \"stuff\" as I went along which in turn motivated me to use it to understand it and get the best from it.However, in hindsight I now understand that those tools were just an enabler to help me realise what was possible rather than what was right. I, like many before me and no doubt after me, thought that a large part of photography was down to equipment and and technical execution but I have learnt since becoming a photography teacher that whilst I can't ignore the need to address the technical execution and tools question the more important and productive question is to ask and examine is the why what is the inspiration for making the image.IMAGE FOR THE TOOL OR TOOL FOR THE IMAGE?Naturally those that get \"into\" photography have a healthy appetite for knowledge and in time, like i did, acquire more equipment such as filters to control dynamic range or exposure time or lenses to photograph close-up (macro) or further away (wildlife and landscapes). Initially once acquired you will follow in the footsteps of all those before you and feel that you have to find a situation to make a shot that means you can use/justify that piece of equipment. The Lee Filters Big Stopper (10 Stop Neutral Density Filter) is a case in point. For a long period when that filter was released you saw image after image (including mine) that were made because someone was trying out their new bit of equipment. Yes, the effects were initially interesting but mainly because they were new, different and not widely seen. They had that instant wow impact and let's be honest here, when we start sharing our first attempts at photography beyond snaps we want to make a statement and impress.View fullsizeLee Big Stopper Filter - FelixstoweThe problem is that amongst \"unaware\" audiences these image have that WOW impact and of course they will shower you with praise and sometimes even bizarre comments of how you should give up your day job to do photography professionally! It's too easy to fall into that trap of believing that the number of likes on Facebook or the comments posted and said to you are a good indication of your photography skills - some will appreciate, and no doubt marvel at the sharpness or vividness of your images, and others may simply want to support your endeavours but ultimately the only judge and jury of an image is you and time.WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU LEARN YOU CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE IMAGE RATHER THAN THE CHOOSE THE IMAGE TO SUIT THE TOOL.Composition is, or as i prefer to call it \"design\", a \"considered\" process of evaluating many things. It starts with your \"intention\" which put simply is the reason, concerns and objective for the image - the thing you want to convey - I refer to this as subject. Secondly, is the narrative that surrounds the subject - it could be the environment, situation at the time or just context of the experience of the photographer.Third is the use if light to create the emotional connection but importantly it's how the photographer uses and treats the light to emphasise their subject and narrative.For me, it's the expression and use of all three that culminates in the use of the tools rather than being led by the tools at our disposal.View fullsizeAutu e the emotional connection but importantly it's how the photographer uses and treats the light to emphasise their subject and narrative.For me, it's the expression and use of all three that culminates in the use of the tools rather than being led by the tools at our disposal.View fullsizeAutumn workshop at Batsford - \"Departed Friends\"My advice is always to choose the tools to suit the job rather than create an image to suit the tools.Referencing back to my first post in this series about relationship and the connection to the subject is what drives us to pick up the camera in the first place. We photograph what we connect to, beit landscapes, people, wildlife, sporting moments, family and friends and portraits, architecture or simply documenting life as we experience it. They are all valid reasons and nothing is cliche if its personal to you because it's your experience rather than someone else's. We all live in bubbles of context from the people around us that we associate with, they generally conform to our own way of thinking and perceiving or that simply exist as part of our daily work and social networks. Therefore it's natural that we will be influenced by them and may even be drawn to making images that fit in with that crowd - being unique is hard, it requires deeper thought and courage, but with it comes immense satisfaction that you are being true to how you interpret and convey your perspective of the subjects you make images of.View fullsizeRock formations - Northumbriaphotography-tips Alan Ranger 5 September 2025Alan Ranger Photography composition-curiousness LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "MASTERING THE ART OF SEASONAL PHOTOGRAPHY: NATURE'S RHYTHMSTable of Contents ShowINTRODUCTION - SEASONAL PHOTOGRAPHYPhotography is an art form that transcends mere visual representation, capturing the essence of life itself. Among the myriad subjects that photographers explore, few are as captivating and ever-changing as the four seasons. Each season brings its unique charm, presenting a kaleidoscope of colours, textures, and moods that beckon to be immortalised through the lens.Mastering the art of seasonal photography requires more than just technical prowess; it demands a deep appreciation for the natural world and an ability to harness its ephemeral beauty. Whether you're a seasoned professional or an enthusiastic amateur, this comprehensive guide will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to capture the essence of each season, transforming fleeting moments into timeless masterpieces. ----------------------------------------SPRING: A CELEBRATION OF REBIRTHThe arrival of spring heralds a symphony of renewal as nature awakens from its winter slumber. This season is a prime opportunity for photographers to capture the delicate beauty of blossoming flowers, vibrant landscapes, and the rejuvenation of life.CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF SPRING 1. Embrace Soft Lighting: Spring is renowned for its gentle, diffused light, which creates a dreamy ambience. Seek out locations where the sun's rays filter through budding trees or dance across meado ming flowers, vibrant landscapes, and the rejuvenation of life.CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF SPRING 1. Embrace Soft Lighting: Spring is renowned for its gentle, diffused light, which creates a dreamy ambience. Seek out locations where the sun's rays filter through budding trees or dance across meadows adorned with wildflowers. 2. Focus on Fresh Landscapes: Pristine landscapes emerge as the earth comes alive, adorned with tender greens and bursts of colour. Train your lens on these natural canvases, capturing the essence of springtime through wide-angle shots or intimate macro perspectives. 3. Highlight Delicate Details: Spring is a season of subtlety, where the smallest details hold profound beauty. Could you Zoom in on the intricate patterns of unfurling leaves, the delicate veins of petals, or the glistening dewdrops that adorn the morning grass? 4. Embrace Pastel Hues: The soft, muted tones of spring lend themselves beautifully to a pastel colour palette. Experiment with compositions that emphasise these gentle hues, creating a harmonious and serene ambiance.SPRING PHOTOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES * Shallow Depth of Field: Utilise a wide aperture to create a shallow depth of field, drawing attention to your subject while subtly blurring the background. * Backlit Compositions: Position yourself so that the sun is behind your subject, creating a warm, glowing effect that highlights the delicate details of spring blooms or foliage. * Long Exposures: Capture the gentle movement of flowing streams or swaying branches by employing long exposure techniques, creating a sense of tranquillity and motion. ----------------------------------------SUMMER: VIBRANT HUES AND GOLDEN HOURSAs the warmth of summer envelops the landscape, photographers are presented with a canvas of vibrant colours, long days, and ample opportunities for outdoor adventures.EMBRACING SUMMER'S RADIANCE 1. Manage Harsh Light: The intense summer sun can cast harsh shadows and create unflattering contrast. Learn to work with diffusers, reflectors, or seek out shaded areas to soften the light and create a more flattering ambiance. 2. Experiment with Sunsets and Shadows: The golden hours of summer offer a wealth of photographic opportunities. Capture the warm, golden tones of a setting sun or play with the long shadows cast by trees and buildings, creating dynamic compositions. 3. Capture Outdoor Activities: Summer is a time for adventure and recreation. Whether it's a family picnic, a day at the beach, or a hiking excursion, document the joyful moments that define the season. 4. Embrace Vivid Colours: From the deep blues of a summer sky to the vibrant greens of lush foliage, summer is a celebration of bold, saturated hues. Could you make your shots to emphasize these striking colours and create a sense of energy and vibrancy?SUMMER PHOTOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES * Fill Flash: Combat harsh shadows by using a fill flash to add a touch of light to your subject, creating a more balanced exposure. * Polarising Filters: Polarising filters enhance the saturation of colours and reduce glare, particularly when shooting landscapes or water scenes. * Panning: Capture the motion and energy of summer activities by panning your camera to follow the movement of your subject, creating a sense of dynamism and action. ----------------------------------------AUTUMN: A TAPESTRY OF WARMTH AND TEXTUREAs the leaves begin to turn and the air takes on a crisp ch e the motion and energy of summer activities by panning your camera to follow the movement of your subject, creating a sense of dynamism and action. ----------------------------------------AUTUMN: A TAPESTRY OF WARMTH AND TEXTUREAs the leaves begin to turn and the air takes on a crisp chill, autumn presents photographers with a rich tapestry of warm tones, textured landscapes, and the bounty of the harvest season.EMBRACING AUTUMN'S GOLDEN HUES 1. Emphasise Texture and Color Contrasts: Autumn is a season of contrasts, where the vibrant hues of fall foliage are juxtaposed against the muted tones of the earth. Seek out compositions that highlight these contrasts, drawing the viewer's eye to the intricate textures and patterns. 2. Capture Harvest Scenes: From pumpkin patches to apple orchards, autumn is a time of abundance and celebration. Document the bounty of the harvest season, capturing the warmth and rustic charm of rural landscapes. 3. Explore Urban Landscapes: Cities take on a different character in autumn, as parks and streets are adorned with a carpet of fallen leaves. Embrace the urban environment, capturing the interplay of autumn colours against the backdrop of architecture and cityscapes. 4. Utilise Natural Light: Autumn's golden light is a photographer's dream. Seek out locations where the warm, diffused light filters through the trees, creating a magical ambiance and accentuating the rich tones of the season.AUTUMN PHOTOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES * Intentional Camera Movement: Create abstract and impressionistic images by intentionally moving your camera during exposure, blurring the details and capturing the essence of autumn's colours and textures. * Reflections: Use calm bodies of water to capture stunning reflections of autumn foliage, creating a sense of symmetry and depth. * Macro Photography: Zoom in on the intricate details of fallen leaves, acorns, or autumn flora, revealing the intricate patterns and textures that often go unnoticed. ----------------------------------------WINTER: MINIMALISM AND MONOCHROME BEAUTYWinter's stark landscapes and monochrome palette offer a unique challenge and opportunity for photographers. Embrace the minimalism and muted tones of this season to create striking, atmospheric images.CAPTURING WINTER'S SERENITY 1. Utilise Minimalism: Winter's barren landscapes lend themselves beautifully to minimalist compositions. Seek out simple subjects and clean lines, allowing negative space to create a sense of tranquillity and contemplation. 2. Explore Monochrome Tones: From the pristine white of freshly fallen snow to the deep greys of a winter sky, winter's muted colour palette is ideally suited for monochrome photography. Experiment with black and white techniques to emphasise texture, contrast, and mood. 3. Embrace Natural Light: Winter's low-angled light can create dramatic shadows and highlights, adding depth and dimension to your compositions. Seek out locations where the sun's rays filter through bare trees or dance across snowy landscapes. 4. Document Winter Activities: Winter is a time for outdoor recreation and celebration. Capture the joy and energy of ice skating, sledging, or cosy gatherings around a crackling fire.WINTER PHOTOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES * Long Exposures: Use long exposure techniques to capture the ethereal movement of falling snow or the smooth flow of a frozen stream, creating a sense of serenity and timelessness. * High-Ke gy of ice skating, sledging, or cosy gatherings around a crackling fire.WINTER PHOTOGRAPHY TECHNIQUES * Long Exposures: Use long exposure techniques to capture the ethereal movement of falling snow or the smooth flow of a frozen stream, creating a sense of serenity and timelessness. * High-Key Lighting: Embrace the bright, reflective nature of snow by using high-key lighting techniques, creating a clean, minimalist aesthetic that emphasises the purity of winter. * Selective Colouring: While monochrome images can be striking, selectively colouring a single element in your composition can add a pop of visual interest and draw the viewer's eye. ----------------------------------------CONCLUSION: EMBRACING THE RHYTHMS OF NATUREMastering the art of seasonal photography is a journey that requires patience, dedication, and a deep appreciation for the natural world.

ISO, one of the core pillars of photography, significantly influences image quality and exposure. As photography enthusiasts seek to create visually arresting and technically sound compositions, acknowledging the role of ISO becomes indispensable. This understanding not only enhances one's ability to adapt to various lighting conditions but also empowers photographers to exploit the creative potential of their camera settings fully. The question of what does ISO stand for in photography—both in its acronymic sense and its functional impact—remains a cornerstone of photographic education, shaping how practitioners approach the craft.T also empowers photographers to exploit the creative potential of their camera settings fully. The question of what does ISO stand for in photography—both in its acronymic sense and its functional impact—remains a cornerstone of photographic education, shaping how practitioners approach the craft.This comprehensive ISO guide aims to demystify what is ISO in photography, delving into its definition, importance, and application. Readers will be introduced to the nuanced ways in which ISO affects exposure, the pros and cons of different ISO settings, and the ideal ISO levels for a variety of scenarios. As the discourse progresses, techniques for managing high ISO noise, the interplay of ISO with other camera settings, and advanced tips for managing ISO efficiently will be explored. Whether one is pondering what ISO mean in photography or how to leverage ISO for better photos and pictures, this guide offers valuable insights and practical advice, equipping photographers with the knowledge to excel in their creative endeavours.WHAT IS ISO IN PHOTOGRAPHY?ISO in photography refers to the sensitivity of the camera's image sensor to light. Essentially, it is a setting that brightens or darkens a photo. When the ISO number is increased, the camera becomes more sensitive to light, making the photo “appear brighter”. This adjustment is crucial in low-light conditions where higher ISO settings help capture images without the need for slow shutter speeds, which can cause blurring.However, increasing the ISO has its drawbacks. High ISO settings can introduce digital noise or grain into the photos, reducing image clarity and detail. The lowest native ISO setting, known as the \"base ISO,\" typically offers the highest image quality with minimal noise, providing the greatest flexibility in post-processing.ISO settings are measured in numbers; common settings include 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and higher. Each step up in ISO doubles the sensitivity of the sensor, allowing light for faster exposure but at the cost of increased noise. In practice, photographers must balance the need for exposure time with the desire to minimise noise for the best image quality.Scene Start at Why Tip Bright daylightISO 100–200Cleanest filesUse aperture for depth of field Shade/overcastISO 200–400Retain safe shutterWatch for camera shake Indoors (no flash)ISO 400–800Compensate low lightStabilise or use faster lens Indoor sportsISO 1600–3200Freeze motionShutter ≥ 1/500s Night streetISO 1600–6400Hand-held in low lightExpose for highlights AstrophotographyISO 3200–12800Stars visibleUse tripod; 500-rule Tripod landscapesISO 100Max qualityDrag shutter as neededView fullsizeUNDERSTANDING ISO NUMBERS - WHAT IS ISO IN PHOTOGRAPHYISO sensitivity in photography is a crucial setting that adjusts the camera sensor's sensitivity to light, standardised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). This setting plays a pivotal role in achieving the right exposure for photographs. A lower ISO number, such as 100 or 200, means the sensor is less sensitive to light, which is ideal for bright conditions and results in clearer, sharper images with minimal noise or grain. Conversely, higher ISO settings, like 3200 or 6400, increase the sensor's sensitivity, allowing for better exposure in low-light conditions but at the cost of increased noise, which can degrade image quality.Photographers adjust ISO to balance the exposure triangle—ISO, shutter speed, and ape n. Conversely, higher ISO settings, like 3200 or 6400, increase the sensor's sensitivity, allowing for better exposure in low-light conditions but at the cost of increased noise, which can degrade image quality.Photographers adjust ISO to balance the exposure triangle—ISO, shutter speed, and aperture—to capture images with the desired brightness and clarity. For instance, in dim lighting, one might increase the ISO to use a faster shutter speed, thus reducing motion blur without compromising on the depth of field provided by the aperture settings. However, it's essential to manage the trade-off between brightness and image noise. Modern cameras often feature advanced noise reduction capabilities, which help mitigate the impact of noise at high ISO settings, preserving more details in the shadows and highlights.Adjusting ISO is not just about managing light; it's also about creative control. Lower ISO values are typically used to achieve high-quality, noise-free photos, especially in controlled lighting conditions like studios or landscapes with ample sunlight. In contrast, higher ISOs may be necessary for capturing scenes in motion or low-light environments without the use of additional lighting equipment or a tripod for handheld shooting.STRUGGLING TO BALANCE ISO, SHUTTER AND APERTURE?Get hands-on guidance in a beginner lesson — camera setup, noise control and real-world practice.Book a Beginner LessonAsk a Mentor a QuestionWHAT DOES ISO STAND FOR?ISO in photography stands for the International Organization for Standardization, which is the body responsible for establishing standardized scales for various measurements, including the sensitivity of film and digital camera sensors to light. The term \"ISO\" itself does not directly refer to photography but is derived from the Greek word 'isos', meaning equal, which is fitting given the standardization role of the ISO organization.When photographers discuss ISO, they are referring to a camera setting that adjusts the sensitivity of the camera's sensor to light. Originally used to describe the sensitivity of film to light, the concept was carried over to digital photography.INTERACTIVE: EXPOSURE CALCULATOROpen full screen or open in a new tab HOW ISO AFFECTS EXPOSURERELATION TO APERTURE AND SHUTTER SPEEDISO works in tandem with aperture and shutter speed to form the exposure triangle, crucial for achieving the desired photographic outcome. For example, if a photographer adjusts the ISO from 200 to 100, they must compensate by either doubling the shutter speed or enlarging the aperture size to maintain the same exposure level. This adjustment is because ISO 100 is half as sensitive to light as ISO 200, requiring twice as much light to achieve a similar exposure.pdf WANT CLEANER LOW-LIGHT SHOTS TONIGHT?Book a 30-min 1-to-1 “ISO & Noise Clinic” on Zoom — bring a few files and we’ll set custom limits, noise reduction and auto-ISO rules for your camera.Book the ISO Clinic (£29) Download Free ISO Field Checklist (PDF) Download Free ISO Field Checklist (PDF) See All Lesson Options & Packages Prefer a text link? Pefer a text link? Download the ISO Checklist PDF THE PROS AND CONS OF DIFFERENT ISO SETTINGSADVANTAGES OF LOW ISOA low ISO setting, typically ISO 300 or lower, results in the highest image quality. Photographers benefit from minimal noise, which ensures clearer and sharper photos. This setting is ideal for bright conditions, such as outdoor photography on a sunny day, where it prevents pictures from appearing washed out. Additionally, low ISO is perfect for landscape photography, enhancing colour fidelity and tonal reproduction, which are crucial for capturing natural scenes.DRAWBACKS OF HIGH ISOAlthough high ISO settings, like ISO 3200 or higher, are beneficial in low-light conditions, they introduce several disadvantages. The most notable is the increase in digital noise or grain, which can significantly degrade image quality. High ISO also affects colour accuracy and reduces the dynamic range, resulting in less contrast and detail in a photo’s bright and dark areas. Furthermore, high ISO settings limit post-processing flexibility due to the pronounced noise levels.QUICK TIPSSUGGESTED ISO RANGES * Daylight: ISO 100–200 for the cleanest files. * Indoors/overcast: ISO 400–800 to keep shutter speeds safe. * Low light/action: ISO 1600–6400+ (freeze motion; manage noise later).CONTROL & TECHNIQUE * Auto ISO + limits: Cap max ISO and set a minimum shutter. * Stabilise: Tripod/IBIS lets you keep ISO lower for static scenes. * Expose well: Underexposure amplifies noise—aim for a healthy histogram.IDEAL ISO SETTINGS FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOSLOW-LIGHT SITUATIONS - WHAT IS ISO IN PHOTOGRAPHY?In scenarios with insufficient ambient light, such as photographing under streetlights or capturing the night sky, photographers should consider higher ISO settings. For general low-light environments, starting at ISO 800 and adjusting upwards as needed is advisable to achieve adequate exposure without excessive noise. When engaging in night photography or astrophotography, one might push the ISO further, up to the highest setting that does not overwhelmingly compromise image quality with noise.FAST-MOVING SUBJECTS - WHAT IS ISO IN PHOTOGRAPHY?Capturing fast-moving subjects, such as wildlife or sports photography, often requires a quick shutter speed to freeze motion effectively. In such cases, ISO settings need to be adjusted accordingly. For instance, photographing birds in flight may require an ISO ranging from 1000 to 3200 or higher, depending on the lighting conditions and the desired shutter speed. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between exposure and motion clarity for action shots.STATIC SUBJECTS - WHAT IS ISO IN PHOTOGRAPHY?For static subjects, especially in controlled lighting c ng from 1000 to 3200 or higher, depending on the lighting conditions and the desired shutter speed. This adjustment helps maintain a balance between exposure and motion clarity for action shots.STATIC SUBJECTS - WHAT IS ISO IN PHOTOGRAPHY?For static subjects, especially in controlled lighting conditions, lower ISO values are preferable. Settings like ISO 100 or 200 are ideal for minimising noise and maximising image sharpness and detail. This is particularly relevant in studio settings or landscape photography, where the lighting can be predicted or managed, allowing for the use of slow shutter speeds and smaller apertures without compromising on image quality. In cases where slight movement is possible due to environmental factors, a slight increase in ISO can help maintain sharpness without introducing significant noise.TECHNIQUES TO MANAGE HIGH ISO NOISENOISE REDUCTION TOOLSManaging high ISO noise effectively requires the use of sophisticated noise reduction tools. One popular option is the DeNoise AI by Topaz, renowned for its ability to handle noise while preserving detail. This tool allows photographers to confidently push ISO settings higher, knowing noise can be effectively managed in post-processing. Another highly recommended tool is DxO PhotoLab's DeepPRIME technology, which provides exceptional noise reduction capabilities, especially in challenging lighting conditions. Adobe Lightroom has significantly improved it noise reduction algorithm in recent updates allowing photographers to shoot at higher ISOs and use noise reduction in post-production.View fullsizeBefore and After Noise Reduction applied in Adobe LightroomPOST-PROCESSING ADJUSTMENTSWhen it comes to managing images shot at high ISOs, post-processing plays a pivotal role. Tools like Adobe Lightroom offer advanced features to recover details from shadows and adjust overall exposure without exacerbating noise issues. For images shot at ISO 5000 or higher, where dynamic range is limited, careful adjustment of exposure and shadow recovery can make a significant difference. Additionally, photographers should be wary of banding and colour shifts during post-processing, particularly when adjusting exposure in images captured at very high ISO settings. Using noise reduction algorithms selectively can help maintain detail while minimising unwanted noise and preserving the integrity of the photograph.EDITING TIPS (5 MINUTES) * Fix exposure first: Lift shadows carefully—heavy pushes reveal noise. * Noise reduction: Balance luminance vs colour NR; keep detail intact. * Sharpen last: Mask edges; avoid sharpening the noise you just removed. * AI denoise: Use sparingly; add micro-contrast back if images look plastic.ADVANCED TIPS FOR MANAGING ISOUSING AUTO ISO EFFECTIVELYEmbracing Auto ISO can significantly streamline the photographic process, especially in dynamic lighting conditions. This feature allows photographers to set their preferred shutter speed and aperture while the camera automatically adjusts the ISO for optimal exposure. The key advantage here is the ability to maintain creative control over depth of field and motion capture without worrying about exposure adjustments.“Unsure what max ISO your camera can handle?

As such, many photographers don’t have the knowledge and understanding of print resolution, aspect ratios, mounting, paper choice and the plethora of challenges that come with making the print. In fairness, even as professional from the digital age, I must work things out each time I go to print, too, though I have done enough exhibitions and other print-related tasks to have a reasonable understanding. “The negative is comparable to the composer's score and the print to its performance. Each performance differs in subtle ways.” Ansel Adams Given that I have many clients, on various courses, and other events wishing to create prints, I felt a guide to the considerations and technicalities would be helpful.IMAGE ASPECT RATIOS: PHOT oser's score and the print to its performance. Each performance differs in subtle ways.” Ansel Adams Given that I have many clients, on various courses, and other events wishing to create prints, I felt a guide to the considerations and technicalities would be helpful.IMAGE ASPECT RATIOS: PHOTO SIZING GUIDESo, what about aspect ratios? In its simplest form, a print aspect ratio is a measurement of the width compared to the height, expressed as a ratio. For example, a full-frame image taken from an SLR camera, without any cropping, is in the ratio of 3:2. Alternatively, this can be expressed as the width of the image being 1.5 times the height of the image. How do aspect ratios relate to cropping? The image below is a full-frame 3:2 image. If we printed this as a 6×4” print, it would not need cropping, but what if we wanted this image in another standard print format – a 10×8”? This would, unfortunately, mean cropping part of the image –possibly a vital part of the composition. The reason is that although the 10×8” print is significantly larger than a 6×4”, its aspect ratio is 5:4. In other words, the larger 10×8” print’s aspect ratio is squarer.

It’s are more elongated than the 10×8” but squarer than the 6×4”. If this seems more confusing, think of in terms of the width as a multiple of the height (or just refer to this table below!). Remember the aspect ratio has nothing to do with the quality and size of the photo it is just the shape of the rectangle – viewing area.View fullsizeImage Size RatioPAPER SIZES: PHOTO SIZING GUIDE We are all familiar with standard paper sizes when it comes to office and home printers. However, the camera doesn’t naturally conform to those standard dimensions when we are printing a photo (uncropped) from a digital SLR camera. The camera photo dimensions (aspect ratio) are based on the sensor or film size, so do not fit the page size easily or equally (the same amount of white space around the photo) Therefore, we have to convert image size to fit standard paper sizes to fill as much of the paper area without cropping the image. Here you can see that the paper aspect ratios do not align perfectly to image aspect ratios. Nearly all the paper sizes in the table below have an aspect ratio of 1.41 which is the closet match to 7 x 5 image aspect ratio (1.4)View fullsizePaper sizes and ratioVIEWING DISTANCE AND PRINT RESOLUTION: PHOTO SIZING GUIDE If the calculation of paper size and image sizes was not already complicated enough, we also need to consider image resolution. Meaning acceptably sharp at “normal viewing distances”.Acceptably sharp is determined by the viewing distance and medium the image is presented on. Assuming you are printing images for viewing rather than seeing on as a projected image (or Mobile device and computer), then a viewing distance of . Meaning acceptably sharp at “normal viewing distances”.Acceptably sharp is determined by the viewing distance and medium the image is presented on. Assuming you are printing images for viewing rather than seeing on as a projected image (or Mobile device and computer), then a viewing distance of 1-3 feet (within arm’s length) is considered the normal range for determining sharpness and details of the print. How do you calculate minimum viewing distance? A generally accepted rule of thumb is that an appropriate minimum print viewing distance is simply the diagonal length of an image multiplied by 1.5 For example, a 36\" x 54\" image would have a diagonal length of about 64.9\". Multiplying 64.9\" by 1.5 results in a viewing distance of about 97.3\" or 8.1 feetView fullsizeViewing distance for photographsView fullsizeViewing DistancesIMAGE RESOLUTION: PHOTO PRINT SIZESIn addition to this the PPI needs to be sufficient to render the image sharp at that viewing distance and size of imagePPI stands for “pixels per inch.” The more pixels per inch, the higher the image resolution. You can see from the chart, below, that PPI, or resolution, is inversely related to the output size and viewing distance. The larger your output AND greater your viewing distance, the fewer pixels per inch that are needed in order to ensure sharp appearance.Therefore, the image resolution must be sufficient in megapixels to ensure you can produce a high-quality print at 200 PPI for minimal, and 300 PPI for high quality as close viewing distance and less than 200 PPI when viewing from greater distances.Pixels per inch (PPI) is a measure of the number of pixels in a digital image, which affects the quality of a printed image. A higher PPI generally results in a higher quality print.RECOMMENDED PPI FOR PRINT * 300 PPI: A good choice for high-quality prints, such as photos for magazines or brochures * 180–240 PPI: A common choice for non-commercial use or smaller designsHow PPI affects print qualityA higher PPI means more pixels per inch, so each pixel can be printed at a higher resolutionThis results in sharper images and smoother gradientsPPI FOR DIFFERENT PRINT JOBSFor small format prints, such as brochures or booklets, 300 PPI is recommendedFor large format prints, such as line images, 200 PPI is recommendedFor photographic images on canvas, 100 PPI is recommendedPPI FOR SCREENSHigher PPI also means more detailed and crisp images on a display. Modern smartphones and high-end monitors often have very high PPI ratingsFormula:View fullsizePrint resolution and PPIThe maths involved to come up with that size print is to first divide the number of pixels in the width of the file by the 200 DPI. (2,000/200=10). Next, divide the number of pixels in the height of the file by 200. (1600/200=8). So, there you have it. A file size of 2,000 pixels X 1600 pixels can be printed to make a good quality 10 X 8 photo when printed at 200 DPI. If you decide to make a print at 300DPI from the same image file, you will have a print with better resolution. However, the maximum size for a quality print will be smaller. The maths would be.... 2,000/300=6.8. Next, 1,600/300=5.3. So, if you round the numbers out, the maximum standard size for that print will be about 7 X 5. The key connection to viewing distance here is that due to the optics of the human eye, a print that is 3x farther away requires exactly 3x less res",

      "articleBody": "COMPOSITION IN PHOTOGRAPHY: WHY THE CAMERA ISN’T THE ARTISTTable of Contents Show---------------------------------------- Creativity starts behind the lens, not inside it. THE CAMERA ISN’T THE ARTIST - YOU AREWe live in an age of astonishing camera technology. Each year, new models promise sharper sensors, faster autofocus, and AI-enhanced wizardry. And while these tools are impressive, there’s a dangerous myth hidden in the marketing: the idea that better gear leads to better photographs.It doesn’t.A camera—no matter how intelligent—isn’t creative. You are. What brings an image to life is not the pixels or megapixels, but your ability to observe, interpret, and compose.This is the essence of composition in photography: understanding how to shape and arrange what’s in front of the lens to communicate something more than just a scene. Something felt.“Photography begins with seeing—not snapping”Abstract, slow-observed detail — ideal for reinforcing the “see more deeply” messageSubtle use of light, texture, and reflection shows patience and compositional awarenessHas visual rhythm without obvious subject — encourages viewers to look, not just recogniseSEEING BEFORE SHOOTING: THE FIRST STEP IN COMPOSITIONBefore we talk about rules or technique, let’s start with the most important skill in learning photography composition: observation.In my article Photography is an Art of Observation , I explored how strong images often come not from dramatic scenes, but from quiet awareness. Noticing subtle patterns, light transitions, or moments of stillness. These moments are fleeting—but the photographer who is truly present sees them.> \"Photography is an art of observation. It has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them\". - Elliott Erwitt Your camera doesn’t see for you. It records. You interpret. You decide. You respond.That’s where composition begins—not with the gridlines on your viewfinder, but with your own sense of what matters in the moment.----------------------------------------“Balance isn’t about symmetry—it’s about harmony and tension”Repetition of similar shapes with subtle variation = classic compositional balance studyOne key in the grid breaks the pattern = introduces tension and draws focusIt embodies the principle discussed: using visual rhythm, then disrupting it to create interestBALANCE, TENSION, AND THE VISUAL CONVERSATIONWhen most people hear the word composition, they think of the rule of thirds or leading lines. And while these are helpful guides, true compositional skill goes deeper.Composition is the practice of creating visual balance, directing attention, and evoking emotion. It’s how you decide what to include—and more importantly, what to leave out.In Finding Your Compositional Balance , I talk about visual weight: how a dark shape might counterbalance a bright highlight, or how negative space can quieten a busy frame. These are not tricks. They are tools—photography composition techniques that give you expressive control.Want to make your image feel peaceful? Use symmetry, soft curves, and spacing. Want tension or energy? Break patterns. Let elements clash.The point is: you are composing a conversation between elements—and like any conversation, the tone and flow are yours to direct.----------------------------------------“A technically perfect photo means nothing if it says nothing.”Clear narrative tension: subject (dog) + framing (window) + lighting (drama) = emotional impactComposition and story are inseparable here: the dog’s expression + placement + contrast with red curtainInstantly evokes questions in the viewer — Why is it waiting? What’s beyond the glass? That’s storytelling.COMPOSITION AND STORYTELLING GO HAND IN HANDMany technically excellent photos still fall flat. Why? Because while they’re well-exposed and well-focused, they don’t say anything.A powerful photograph speaks. It suggests. It invites. It asks.This is where photographic storytelling becomes an essential partner to composition.

That doesn’t mean they need captions—it means they need clarity of intent.Every element you include contributes to the message. Every distraction you remove strengthens it.This is one of the most overlooked yet vital composition photography tips: Always ask yourself, 'What is this photograph trying to say?'----------------------------------------“Style isn’t found. It’s revealed through repetition.”The visual structure is bold, personal, and unmistakably intentionalStrong contrast between the red stone and the swirling textured lines evokes identity, focus, and placement — perfect metaphors for developing your styleIt feels crafted and discovered — not just seenYOUR STYLE IS HIDDEN IN THE DECISIONS YOU MAKEOften, students ask me: “How do I find my photography style?”Here’s the truth: your style already exists. It’s hiding in the patterns of your decisions. The way you compose. The light you chase. The subjects that make you pause.Style is not something you manufacture—it emerges over time when you consistently shoot with intention.In How to Find Your Photography Style , I encourage photographers to look for these quiet consistencies. They reveal your natural voice, and that voice is often expressed most clearly through your compositional choices.Where do you place your subject? Do you embrace shadows or avoid them? Are your frames open and airy, or dense and layered? These questions are not technical—they’re deeply personal.Take the FREE online Photography Style Quiz to discover YOURS ----------------------------------------CAN YOU REALLY LEARN PHOTOGRAPHY COMPOSITION?Yes. Unequivocally.But not through shortcuts or gimmicks. The only way to truly learn photography composition is to shoot deliberately, to reflect critically, and to stay curious.Too much emphasis is placed on talent. The truth is, composition is a skill—one that gets stronger the more you practise it with intent. Study master photographers. Try simple creative exercises. Slow down. Repeat.One of the most important photography composition techniques is simply giving yourself permission to experiment.You don’t need a better lens to compose a better photo. You need time, space, and the willingness to observe more carefully.----------------------------------------CLOSING THOUGHT: COMPOSE WITH FEELING, NOT JUST TECHNIQUEThe next time you’re out with your camera, don’t chase the \"perfect shot.\" Instead, chase meaning. Look for shapes that echo each other. Wait for the light to shift. Ask yourself what story this frame could tell.Composition isn’t about placing objects in a neat arrangement. It’s about seeing with depth, feeling the moment, and expressing something through form, balance, and intention.No camera—no matter how smart—can do that for you.But you can.----------------------------------------TOP TIPS FOR MASTERING COMPOSITION IN PHOTOGRAPHY1. OBSERVE BEFORE YOU COMPOSEDon’t rush to shoot. Pause. Look. Let the scene reveal its potential. Great compositions start with patient observation and a willingness to see beyond the obvious.> “Photography begins with seeing—not snapping.”2. THINK IN TERMS OF BALANCE, NOT RULESForget strict formulas. Composition isn’t just about the rule of thirds—it’s a t the scene reveal its potential. Great compositions start with patient observation and a willingness to see beyond the obvious.> “Photography begins with seeing—not snapping.”2. THINK IN TERMS OF BALANCE, NOT RULESForget strict formulas. Composition isn’t just about the rule of thirds—it’s about creating visual harmony or tension that serves your intention.> Balance might mean symmetry, or it might mean deliberate imbalance that provokes curiosity.3. TELL A STORY, DON’T JUST SHOW A SCENEAsk yourself: What is this photo saying? Strong compositions guide the eye and spark emotion. They’re not just well-arranged—they’re expressive.> “A technically perfect photo means nothing if it says nothing.”4. STYLE COMES FROM REPETITION, NOT FILTERSYour style will develop through consistent, intentional choices—how you frame, what you include, and what kind of light you gravitate toward.> “Your style lives in the choices you make—frame after frame.”5. FORGET GEAR. FOCUS ON VISION.The camera is just a tool. It’s your eye, your decisions, and your emotional connection that give a photograph its voice.> “Creativity starts behind the lens, not inside it.”💬 BONUS TIP: SLOW DOWNThe best compositions often come when you give yourself time—time to notice, time to respond, and time to refine your frame with care.View fullsize----------------------------------------FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT COMPOSITION IN PHOTOGRAPHY1. CAN I LEARN COMPOSITION EVEN IF I'M NOT NATURALLY CREATIVE?Absolutely. Creativity isn’t a fixed trait—it’s a muscle. Composition is a visual language that anyone can learn to speak fluently with practice. It’s about seeing relationships between elements in a frame, and that comes with awareness and repetition. If you're willing to observe more thoughtfully and reflect on your choices, your composition will improve.2. WHAT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE OF COMPOSITION?There isn’t just one—and that’s the point. While guides like the rule of thirds or leading lines are useful, no single rule fits every situation. The most important thing is intention: every element you include (or exclude) should serve a purpose. Think of composition not as a set of rules, but as a set of tools to help you express your vision.3. HOW DO I KNOW IF MY COMPOSITION IS WORKING?A good starting point is to ask yourself: Where does my eye go first? What emotion or story does the image suggest? Are there distractions pulling attention away from the subject? Over time, your instinct will grow. Sharing your work with others and seeking constructive feedback can also reveal compositional strengths and weaknesses you might not notice yourself.4. SHOULD I ALWAYS COMPOSE IN-CAMERA, OR CAN I CROP LATER?It’s always best to get the strongest composition in-camera. This builds your observational and framing skills in real time. Cropping in post can refine things, but relying on it too often can lead to sloppy shooting habits. Training yourself to compose at the moment of capture is one of the most valuable skills a photographer can develop.5. WHAT’S THE BEST WAY TO PRACTISE COMPOSITION IN PHOTOGRAPHY?Slow down. Choose a simple subject—like a doorway, a tree, or a shadow—and photograph it in five different ways. Change your position. Experiment with spacing. Play with light. Then review your results and ask why some frames feel more compelling than others. Composition improves not through random shooting, but throug simple subject—like a doorway, a tree, or a shadow—and photograph it in five different ways. Change your position. Experiment with spacing. Play with light. Then review your results and ask why some frames feel more compelling than others. Composition improves not through random shooting, but through deliberate seeing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------photography-tips , online photography course Alan Ranger 26 July 2025Alan Ranger Photography bonus module LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

This guide explains what dynamic range is, why it matters, and how to manage it in your photography.3 key takeaways * Understand: What dynamic range means in photography and how it differs from what the human eye sees. * Control: Practical shooting tips for handling scenes with high contrast, from metering choices to exposure bracketing. * Improve: How to recover or extend dynamic range in editing, and when to use HDR techniques.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------As a photographer, have you ever marvelled at how sunlight dances across a landscape, creating a tapestry of highlights and shadows? Or perhaps you've struggled to capture the subtle details in both the brightest and darkest areas of a scene. If so, you've encountered the concept of dynamic range - a fundamental aspect of photography that can make or break your images.WHAT IS DYNAMIC RANGE IN PHOTOGRAPHY?Dynamic range in photography refers to the range of light intensities a camera can capture in a single exposure, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. The camera can essentially see and record detail across a spectrum of luminosity.Imagine standing a DYNAMIC RANGE IN PHOTOGRAPHY?Dynamic range in photography refers to the range of light intensities a camera can capture in a single exposure, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. The camera can essentially see and record detail across a spectrum of luminosity.Imagine standing at the edge of a forest at sunset. Your eyes can perceive the rich, dark greens of the shadowy undergrowth while simultaneously taking in the brilliant oranges and reds of the sky. This is your visual system's dynamic range at work. But can your camera capture all of that information in one shot?THE TECHNICAL NITTY-GRITTYFor the more technically inclined, let's dive deeper. Dynamic range is typically measured in stops or exposure values (EV). Each stop represents a doubling or halving of light intensity. Modern digital cameras can typically capture between 12-14 stops of dynamic range, with some high-end models pushing beyond 15 stops.Here's where it gets interesting: the human eye can perceive a dynamic range of about 20 stops in a single glance and up to 24 stops when accounting for pupil adjustment. This disparity between what we see and what our cameras can capture is at the heart of many photographic challenges.What is Dynamic Range in PhotographyDYNAMIC RANGE IN ACTIONLANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY: NATURE'S HIGH CONTRAST CANVASLandscape photography often presents scenes with extreme ranges in light. Picture a mountain vista with deep, shadowy valleys and snow-capped peaks reflecting bright sunlight. This scenario can easily exceed your camera's dynamic range capabilities.Pro Tip: In high-contrast landscape scenes, try bracketing your exposures . Take multiple shots at different exposure levels and blend them in post-processing to capture the full dynamic range of the scene.Shot at 1/1600 sec to capture highlight detailsShot at 1/400 secShot at 1/100 sec to capture shadow detailsThree exposures blended together in Adobe LightroomHIGH-CONTRAST URBAN SCENES: THE CITY'S LIGHT AND SHADOW PLAYUrban environments, with their mix of bright lights and dark alleys, are another playground for exploring a challenging range of light. A nighttime cityscape can push your camera to its limits, challenging you to balance the glow of street lamps against the inky blacks of shadowed buildings.LOW-LIGHT SITUATIONS: WHEN EVERY PHOTON COUNTSIn low-light photography, such as astrophotography or dimly lit interiors, the light range becomes crucial. Your camera needs to capture faint light sources without blowing out brighter areas. This is where the quality of your camera's sensor really shines (pun intended!).WORKING WITH LIGHT STOPS 1. Understand Your Camera: Each camera model has its own dynamic range capabilities. Experiment with your gear to learn its limits. 2. Use HDR Techniques: High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography involves taking multiple exposures and combining them to extend the captured range of light, known as exposure bracketing. 3. Embrace the Histogram: Your camera's histogram is a powerful tool for understanding light distribution in your scene. Learn to read it and use it to your advantage. Read my post of exposure 4. Shoot in RAW: RAW files contain more data than JPEGs, giving you greater flexibility in post-processing to recover highlights and shadows. 5. Master Exposure Compensation: Sometimes, intentionall t and use it to your advantage. Read my post of exposure 4. Shoot in RAW: RAW files contain more data than JPEGs, giving you greater flexibility in post-processing to recover highlights and shadows. 5. Master Exposure Compensation: Sometimes, intentionally under or overexposing can help you capture more detail in highlights or shadows.Take a look at the NEW outdoor exposure calculator tool QUICK TIPSSHOOTING * Check histogram and highlight warnings, not LCD brightness. * Expose for highlights; recover shadows in RAW. * Use bracketing (+/-2 EV) when scene contrast is extreme.PRACTICAL SETUP * Shoot at base ISO to minimise noise in shadows. * Use a tripod or IBIS for stability; remote or timer if possible. * Grad ND filters help balance bright skies with darker land.THE ART OF USING THE LARGE RANGE OF LIGHTWhile understanding the technical aspects of dynamic range is important, remember that photography is an art form. Sometimes, embracing the limitations of the range can lead to striking, high-contrast images that convey mood and drama.Consider the work of legendary landscape photographer Ansel Adams. His mastery of light through his Zone System resulted in images with incredible tonal range, from the deepest blacks to the brightest whites, each conveying rich detail and texture.EDITING TIPS (5 MINUTES) * Start with white balance: keep it consistent across the series before tonal edits. * Recover highlights first: bring back cloud or bright sky detail, then open shadows. * Use local masks: balance sky vs foreground; add contrast selectively, not globally. * Noise control: apply noise reduction in deep shadows, but preserve fine detail. * Keep HDR natural: avoid halos, harsh edges, or oversaturated recovered tones.PUSHING THE BOUNDARIESAs camera technology advances, we're seeing incredible improvements in sensor range capabilities. The latest sensors are pushing closer to the human eye's abilities, opening up new creative possibilities.But remember, great photography isn't just about capturing everything the eye can see. It's about interpretation, emotion, and storytelling. Understanding light is a tool in your artistic arsenal - use it wisely to create images that not only capture a scene but convey your unique vision. It will also be beneficial to understand what do camera filters do to help improve the capture of a high dynamic range.MASTER DYNAMIC RANGE IN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHYDownload the 1-page field checklist and take control of highlights and shadows.Download Dynamic Range Checklist (PDF) 1-to-1 Zoom Help HDR Clinic (Zoom, £29) Prefer a text link?

It's about seeing light in new ways, understanding the interplay of shadows and highlights, and learning to work with (or against) the limitations of your equipment.So the next time you're out shooting, take a moment to really look at the light. See the subtle gradations, the play of highlights and shadows. Then, armed with your knowledge of the dynamic range, capture that scene in a way that tells your story.Remember, every great photograph is a dance between light and shadow. Dynamic range is your invitation to that dance. Will you accept?----------------------------------------FAQSQ1: WHAT IS DYNAMIC RANGE IN PHOTOGRAPHY?A1: Dynamic range in photography refers to the range of light intensities from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights that a camera sensor can capture. It essentially measures how well a camera can handle scenes with both very bright and very dark elements without losing detail in either.Q2: WHY IS DYNAMIC RANGE IMPORTANT IN PHOTOGRAPHY?A2: Dynamic range is crucial because it determines how well a camera can capture a scene with varying light levels. A camera with a high dynamic range can record more details in both the shadows and highlights, resulting in more realistic and vibrant images. It is especially important for landscape photography or scenes with strong contrasts.Q3: HOW IS DYNAMIC RANGE MEASURED?A3: Dynamic range is typically measured in stops. Each stop represents a doubling or halving of light. For example, if a camera has a dynamic range of 12 stops, it can capture a range of light intensities from the darkest areas (shadow details) to the brightest (highlight details) in a scene.Q4: WHAT FACTORS AFFECT A CAMERA'S DYNAMIC RANGE?A4: Several factors can influence a camera's dynamic range, including: * Sensor technology: Different sensor designs (CCD vs. CMOS) and sizes can impact dynamic range. * Bit depth: Cameras with higher bit depths (e.g., 14-bit vs. 12-bit) can capture more levels of brightness and color. * Post-processing: Techniques like HDR imaging can extend the perceived dynamic range of an image by combining multiple exposures.Q5: CAN I IMPROVE THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF MY PHOTOS IN POST-PROCESSING?A5: While you can't change the inherent dynamic range of your camera, you can use post-processing techniques to enhance your photos. High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging allows you to blend multiple exposures of the same scene to capture a wider range of light intensities, bringing out details in both shadows and highlights.Q6: HOW DOES DYNAMIC RANGE DIFFER BETWEEN CAMERAS?A6: Different cameras and sensors exhibit varying levels of dynamic range. Generally, higher-end DSLRs and mirrorless cameras tend to have better dynamic range than entry-level or compact cameras. Full-frame sensors often outperform crop sensors in dynamic range due to their larger size, which allows for more light capture.Q7: WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF LOW DYNAMIC RANGE IN MY PHOTOS?A7: Photos taken with a low dynamic range may display blown-out highlights (areas that are pure white with no de ll-frame sensors often outperform crop sensors in dynamic range due to their larger size, which allows for more light capture.Q7: WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF LOW DYNAMIC RANGE IN MY PHOTOS?A7: Photos taken with a low dynamic range may display blown-out highlights (areas that are pure white with no detail) or blocked-up shadows (areas that are black with no detail). This results in a lack of tonal variation and can make an image feel flat or uninteresting.Q8: IS DYNAMIC RANGE THE SAME FOR ALL PHOTOGRAPHY GENRES?A8: While dynamic range is essential across all photography genres, its significance may vary depending on the context. For instance, in portrait photography, the focus may be on skin tones and softer lighting, whereas in landscape photography, capturing a wide dynamic range can be vital to show the details in both the sky and the ground.Q9: WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE HUMAN EYE COMPARED TO CAMERAS?A9: The human eye has an impressive dynamic range, estimated to be around 20 stops or more. This allows us to perceive a wide range of light and dark in a single glance. Cameras, however, typically have a more limited dynamic range, usually between 10 to 15 stops for most consumer models, which is why careful exposure techniques are necessary to capture scenes effectively.Q10: WHAT TECHNIQUES CAN HELP ME HANDLE DYNAMIC RANGE IN MY PHOTOGRAPHY?A10: To manage dynamic range in photography, consider the following techniques: * Use graduated neutral density filters to balance exposure between bright and dark areas. * Employ bracketing techniques to create HDR images. * Carefully plan your shooting time, using golden hour light to minimise harsh contrasts. * Learn to use camera settings like exposure compensation effectively to capture details in shadows or highlights.📚 CONTINUE LEARNING * Next lesson: → What is Exposure in Photography * Next lesson: → Exposure Bracketing: A Guide for Photographers * Next lesson: → What is White Balance in Photography * Personal support: → HDR Clinic (Zoom, £29) 15 modules Downloadable certificate Auto-graded module examEXAMS & CERTIFICATION ADD-ONAlready learning with the free course?

Done well, it simplifies the picture, adds depth, and directs attention. This guide shows quick, repeatable ways to find frames anywhere—no new gear required.3 KEY TAKEAWAYS * Find natural frames fast: doorways, windows, trees, railings, light/shadow, colour blocks, people and props. Keep the subject clean of mergers. * Control edges & depth: use the frame near the lens for foreground depth; place your subject on a strong rule-of-thirds line; watch corners/edges for clutter. * Refine with settings: choose aperture for subject separation (f/2.8–f/5.6 for blur, f/8–f/11 for context); focus on the subject, not the frame; expose for the subject and let the frame fall darker if needed.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS FRAMING IN PHOTOGRAPHYIn photography, the power of framing cannot be overstated. It is the cornerstone of composition, transforming ordinary scenes into captivating works of art. Framing in photography is not just about what is included within the borders of an image; it's about how elements are arranged to guide the viewer's eye and tell a story. Whether through the symmetry of geometric shapes, the balance of light and sha ing ordinary scenes into captivating works of art. Framing in photography is not just about what is included within the borders of an image; it's about how elements are arranged to guide the viewer's eye and tell a story. Whether through the symmetry of geometric shapes, the balance of light and shadow, or the guidance of leading lines, mastering framing techniques can significantly enhance the visual impact of photographs. This skilful manipulation of elements within the frame to create a focal point or to isolate the subject from its surroundings elevates the photographer from simply capturing images to crafting visual narratives.This beginner’s guide will delve into the concept of framing in photography, outlining popular framing techniques such as the rule of thirds, the use of geometric shapes, and the strategic placement of a subject within a frame for optimal isolation. Readers will learn about various situations where framing can dramatically improve their photographs, from landscapes to portraiture, and discover best practices for employing these compositional techniques effectively. By exploring the subtle art of framing photographs, this guide will equip aspiring photographers with the tools they need to not only improve their technical skills but also to unlock their creative potential, turning their visions into compelling photographic compositions.FRAMING — QUICK TIPS * Subject first: keep the subject brighter/sharper than the frame. * Leave a breathing gap: avoid edge kisses and mergers; tidy corners. * Use near-lens foreground: branches/doorways add depth—move your feet to clean edges. * Exposure bias: meter for the subject and let the frame sit ~−0.7 to −1.3 EV darker. * Focus control: single AF point on the subject; don’t let AF grab the frame. * Aperture choice: f/2.8–f/5.6 to blur frame; f/8–f/11 when you want context. * Alignment matters: watch verticals/horizons; square up when geometry is strong. * Reflections & glare: change angle; a polariser can help but don’t kill useful reflections. * Backlight safety: bracket if needed; protect highlights on faces/labels. * Try a clean version: shoot one frame with and one without the “frame” for comparison. * Edit finish: crop for clean edges; subtle burn on the frame, gentle dodge on the subject. * Tripod/IBIS: handy for precise composition and repeatable variations.THE CONCEPT OF FRAMING IN PHOTOGRAPHYFraming in photography is a powerful compositional technique that significantly influences the viewer's perception and interaction with an image. It involves the deliberate use of elements within a scene to surround the main subject, which can guide the viewer’s focus and enhance the overall impact of the photograph.UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNIQUEFraming can be achieved using both natural and man-made elements. Photographers often use tree branches, windows, or doorways to create a natural frame and often a frame within a frame around the subject. This method not only focuses the viewer’s attention but also adds depth to the image, making it appear more three-dimensional. For instance, an image of a mountain taken from inside a tent frames the scene through the tent’s doorway, offering a unique perspective that differs markedly from a direct shot of the mountain. Similarly, a photo captured from an airplane window uses the window as a frame to selectively show a portion of the sky, creating a more intimate and focused view of the vastness outside.A h the tent’s doorway, offering a unique perspective that differs markedly from a direct shot of the mountain. Similarly, a photo captured from an airplane window uses the window as a frame to selectively show a portion of the sky, creating a more intimate and focused view of the vastness outside.Another technique involves using leading lines or architectural elements such as bridges, tunnels, and archways that naturally lead the eye towards the main subject. These compositional tools are not just about what is included but also about what is deliberately excluded from the image. By deciding what to leave out, the photographer can strengthen the story they wish to tell through their photograph.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDThe concept of framing is not new and has been utilised in various forms of visual art to bring attention to the focal point. In photography, its use has evolved with the medium itself, providing an essential tool for photographers to manipulate their viewer's experience and interpretation of the scene. Historically, framing was used to bring order and structure to a composition, often highlighting the central theme or subject. Today, it remains a fundamental technique in photography, applicable across different genres from landscape to portrait photography.Framing is more than just a compositional technique; it is a narrative device. It allows photographers to control how the story is told, emphasising certain elements while downplaying others. Its strategic use can transform a simple photograph into a compelling visual story, demonstrating that sometimes, what one chooses to exclude is as impactful as what is included.Framing simplifies a scene and directs attention by placing your subject inside a natural or created border.POPULAR FRAMING TECHNIQUESUSING NATURAL ELEMENTSNatural elements provide a dynamic and organic way to frame subjects in photography . Photographers often utilise tree branches, bodies of water, and even light patterns to create natural borders that draw the viewer's eye directly to the focal point of the image. This technique not only adds depth and interest but also integrates the subject seamlessly into the surrounding environment, enhancing the narrative of the photograph.ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURESArchitectural features such as archways, windows, and elaborate doorways serve as effective framing tools in photography. These structures guide the viewer’s eye towards the main subject and add a layer of context and scale to the image. Utilising architecture allows photographers to play with symmetry and leading lines, creating a visually appealing and structured composition that emphasises the subject.LIGHT AND SHADOWSMastering the interplay of light and shadows can dramatically alter the mood and depth of a photograph. Photographers use shadows to create leading lines that guide the eye or to highlight contrasts within the frame, adding a three-dimensional quality to flat images. This technique is particularly effective in black and white photography where the drama of chiaroscuro (light-dark contrast) can be fully explored to create striking, memorable compositions.GEOMETRICAL SHAPESGeometric framing involves using shapes such as squares, rectangles, and repeated patterns to create a visually striking framework around the subject. This technique is often used in architectural and urban photograp fully explored to create striking, memorable compositions.GEOMETRICAL SHAPESGeometric framing involves using shapes such as squares, rectangles, and repeated patterns to create a visually striking framework around the subject. This technique is often used in architectural and urban photography, where the natural and man-made structures provide numerous opportunities to capture compelling, geometrically framed shots. The simplicity and balance achieved through geometric framing make it a powerful tool for drawing attention directly to the subject while maintaining a clean and organised aesthetic.SITUATIONS TO UTILISE FRAMINGENHANCING STORYTELLINGFraming in photography is a key technique that shapes the narrative of an image. It allows photographers to highlight what is essential while omitting less relevant elements, thus steering the story in a desired direction . For instance, by choosing to frame a single child jumping over a log, the photographer shifts the focus from group activity to an individual's experience, subtly altering the story from one of camaraderie to one of personal challenge or enjoyment. This selective framing helps in conveying a more focused narrative, whether it's showcasing solitude, joy, or any subtle shifts in the dynamics of the subjects involved.CAPTURING DEPTHEffective framing also plays a crucial role in adding depth to photographs, making them more engaging and lifelike. Techniques such as using natural frames like tree branches or architectural elements like windows can add layers to an image, offering a three-dimensional feel. This method not only enriches the visual appeal but also enhances the viewer's engagement with the image. By manipulating foreground and background elements through framing, photographers can lead the viewer's eye through the image, from the most immediate subjects to those in the distant background, crafting a more immersive experience. Incorporating elements like diagonal lines or converging lines can further emphasise depth, guiding the viewer’s gaze into the vanishing point, adding a profound sense of space and perspective to the scene.GRAB THE 1-PAGE FRAMING FIELD CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 guide — framing types, setup & quick exercises.Download Framing Field Checklist (PDF) Book 1-to-1 Framing Help (Zoom) Book the Composition Clinic (£29) Prefer a text link? Download the Framing Field Checklist (PDF) BEST PRACTICES FOR FRAMINGCHOOSING THE RIGHT ELEMENTSWhen framing a photograph, selecting the right elements to include in the frame is crucial. One should consider the relationship between the subjects and the surrounding environment. For instance, a photographer might choose to capture a balanced photograph by strategically placing subjects within the frame, considering the camera-subject distance, camera settings, and s frame is crucial. One should consider the relationship between the subjects and the surrounding environment. For instance, a photographer might choose to capture a balanced photograph by strategically placing subjects within the frame, considering the camera-subject distance, camera settings, and shooting angles. This careful selection of elements and their arrangement can dramatically affect the relationship between them, altering the weight each carries within the frame.BALANCING THE FRAMEAchieving balance in a photograph is essential, whether through symmetrical or asymmetrical composition. Symmetry often conveys a sense of calm and order, ideal for scenes that aim to evoke peace and serenity. Asymmetry, on the other hand, can introduce dynamism and tension, suitable for more dramatic themes. Photographers must consider the visual weight of elements, ensuring that no single part of the image overwhelms the others, thus maintaining a harmonious composition. Techniques such as the rule of thirds, the strategic use of negative space, and the placement of focal points are instrumental in achieving this balance.MAINTAINING SUBJECT CLARITYEnsuring the main subject remains the focal point of the photograph is paramount. This can be accomplished by isolating the subject from its surroundings, using techniques like depth of field adjustments or framing within a frame. For example, using a shallow depth of field can help minimize distractions, making the subject stand out. Additionally, the use of natural or architectural frames can help to encapsulate the subject, drawing the viewer’s eye directly to it and away from less relevant elements in the scene.CONCLUSIONThroughout this guide, we have explored the profound influence framing holds in the world of photography, from its historical roots to its modern-day application across various genres. By carefully selecting and arranging elements within the frame, photographers can guide the viewer's attention, evoke emotional responses, and convey a deeper narrative. The techniques discussed, including the use of natural elements, architectural structures, interplay of light and shadows, and geometric shapes, equip beginners with a foundational understanding of how to enhance their photographic compositions effectively. Emphasizing the importance of storytelling, capturing depth, and maintaining the clarity of the subject further underscores framing's role in crafting compelling photographic narratives.As aspiring photographers experiment with these principles, they should remember that mastery comes with practice and exploration. The journey of discovering one's unique visual style is as much about learning the rules as it is about knowing when to break them ingeniously. By applying these framing techniques with creativity and intention, photographers can unlock new dimensions in their work, transforming ordinary scenes into extraordinary visual stories. Thus, framing is not merely a compositional tool but a lens through which photographers can view the world, offering infinite possibilities to express, explore, and connect with their subjects and viewers alike.----------------------------------------EDITING TIPS (5 MINUTES) * Crop for clean edges: remove tangents/mergers; keep a small “breathing gap” around the subject. * Straighten & perspective: level horizons; use vertical transform if the frame has architecture. * Subject vs frame brightness: lift subject mid-ton",

This is often conveyed through unique expressions and settings. A skilled portrait photographer uses their understanding of lighting and ability to direct the subject to bring out their most authentic selves. This may involve capturing candid moments or carefully composed images that tell a story or reveal deeper truths about the individual.EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUESTo achieve high-quality portrait photos, photographers rely on various equipment and techniques. A standard zoom lens is essential, typically ranging from 24mm to 70mm Portrait photography allows for flexibility in shooting different styles, from close-ups to full-body images. For mo AND TECHNIQUESTo achieve high-quality portrait photos, photographers rely on various equipment and techniques. A standard zoom lens is essential, typically ranging from 24mm to 70mm Portrait photography allows for flexibility in shooting different styles, from close-ups to full-body images. For more detailed work, such as headshots or images where background compression is favourable, a medium telephoto lens, like an 85mm to 105mm, is preferred due to its flattering effects on facial features.Lighting plays a crucial role, with many photographers opting for natural light to maintain the softness and realism of the portrait. However, mastering artificial lighting setups Artificial lighting can significantly enhance the versatility and quality of the photos, especially in controlled environments like studios. Reflectors and diffusers are also commonly used to manipulate light and shadows to soften features and highlight the subject's best traits.WORKING WITH SUBJECTSThe interaction between the photographer and the subject is critical in portrait photography. Photographers must possess excellent interpersonal skills to make their subjects feel at ease, which helps in capturing more natural and relaxed expressions. It's also essential for photographers to communicate effectively, guiding subjects through various poses and expressions to find the most flattering and expressive shots.For non-professional models, photographers often follow simple directions and work to create a comfortable atmosphere. They sometimes use props or engage in conversation to elicit natural poses and expressions. This approach helps reveal the subject's personality, making the portrait more engaging and personal.By combining technical skills with an empathetic approach, portrait photographers can create compelling images that capture the likeness and essence of the person in front of the lens.LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY - PHOTOGRAPHY STYLESLANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY — QUICK TIPS * Scout light first: golden/blue hours are best. * Compose with foreground–midground–background layers. * Use tripod, low ISO, small aperture (f/11–f/16). * Filters: ND for exposure control, polariser for skies/water.TECHNIQUES FOR BREATHTAKING SCAPESLandscape photography is profoundly influenced by natural light, which dictates not only the aesthetics but also the technical settings of the camera. On bright sunny days, photographers can utilise fast shutter speeds, fast shutter speeds and low apertures ensuring everything in the scene remains in focus. Conversely, overcast or rainy conditions may require larger apertures or increased ISO values to achieve similar shutter speeds, affecting the depth of field and, potentially, the image's clarity.Understanding the sun's position relative to the scene is crucial in landscape photography. For instance, side lighting is preferred for its ability to create shadows and add depth, making it ideal for landscapes with distinct shapes like mountains or forests. Backlighting, although challenging due to the risk of sun glares, can provide dramatic contrasts and is often used during golden hours for its warm colours and soft light. Techniques such as using graduated neutral density filters or luminosity masking in post-processing can help manage the high contrast and prevent overexposure.UNDERSTANDING NATURAL LIGHTThe intensity and colour of natural light vary throughout the day, influenced by factors such as weather and se chniques such as using graduated neutral density filters or luminosity masking in post-processing can help manage the high contrast and prevent overexposure.UNDERSTANDING NATURAL LIGHTThe intensity and colour of natural light vary throughout the day, influenced by factors such as weather and season. Light during the golden hours—shortly after sunrise or before sunset—offers a spectrum of warm tones, casting a magical glow that enhances the beauty of the surroundings. warm shades that enhance the visual appeal The blue hours, on the other hand, provide subtle blue and violet tones, creating a different mood and aesthetic vital for landscape photography. Photographers must consider these variations to capture the desired emotional impact of the landscape, as the colour of light can significantly alter the perception of a scene.Natural light also changes with the seasons, with winter and autumn light being less intense and sometimes misty, ideal for creating moody, low-saturated compositions in landscape photography, while summer offers clear, bright light perfect for vibrant, detailed images.COMPOSITION AND PERSPECTIVEEffective landscape photography composition involves more than just the arrangement of visual elements; it's about creating a connection with the viewer. Visual pathways, for example, guide the viewer’s eye through the image, creating depth and a sense of journey in landscape photography. The perspective can be manipulated by the photographer’s position, influencing how elements like mountains or trees are perceived in size and distance.Using a tripod is recommended Using a tripod to stabilise the camera, especially during long exposures or in dim lighting conditions, allows for precise adjustments and sharper images, making it an essential tool for capturing the beauty of landscapes. Exploring different angles and perspectives Panning by moving the camera can help frame the perfect shot, making the composition appear more dynamic and engaging, adding a sense of motion to the stillness of landscapes.Incorporating elements like reflections can create symmetry and balance in landscape photography, adding a tranquil and sometimes surreal effect to the photographs. Contrast and colour harmony are also vital in enhancing the image’s visual impact, drawing attention to specific areas or creating a focal point.By understanding these techniques and the behaviour of natural light, photographers can significantly enhance their skills in landscape photography, capturing breathtaking scapes that resonate with viewers and convey the intended artistic vision.TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY - PHOTOGRAPHY STYLESTRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHY — QUICK TIPS * Tell a place story: opener, detail, portrait, context, night. * Shoot dawn/dusk for mood; scout midday for angles. * Be respectful: ask permission; share images when possible. * Pack light, back up daily, and log locations for captions.Travel photography is a captivating genre that merges the art of photography with the thrill of exploration.

Finding one's photography style goes beyond mastering technical skills; it's about discovering a visual language that resonates with personal creativity and connects with viewers on an emotional level. As photographers explore different genres, experiment with composition, and refine their editing techniques, they begin to craft a distinctive visual narrative that reflects their artistic vision.This article delves into the essential steps on how to find your photography style and develop your own style. From analysing favourite photos and exploring various genres to creating a cohesive portfolio and embracing feedback, readers will learn valuable techniques to enhance their creative vision. The guide also covers the importance of consistent editing, defining a unique photographic perspective, and allowing one's style to evolve over time. By following these insights, photographers can embark on a rewarding journey to find their style and create images that truly showcase their artistic voice.ANALYSE YOUR FAVOURITE PHOTOSQUICK TIPS — ANALYSE YOUR FAVOURITE PHOTOS * Identify common elements: Gather 30–40 cherished images and look for recurring themes, moods, or subjects. * Note composition techniques: Spot patterns like use of negative space, rule of thirds, or filling the frame. * Examine lighting & mood: Analyse quality, direction, and colour of light to understand the atmosphere you prefer.To identify and develop a unique photography style, photographers should start by examining their favourite images. This process involves a deep dive into personal preferences and artistic choices. Here's how to approach this analysis:IDENTIFY COMMON ELEMENTSPhotographers should gather a collection of their most cherished images, ideally 3 to 4 dozen. They need to look for similarities and patterns across these photos. This could include recurring themes, subjects, or visual elements. By brain-dumping words or phrases that come to mind when viewing these images, photographers can begin to articulate their style. For instance, words like romantic, feminine, strong, nostalgic, colourful, contrasty, soft, or dreamy might emerge repeatedly.NOTE COMPOSITION TECHNIQUESExamining the composition of favourite photos has an influence on understanding one's preferred visual language. Photographers should pay attention to how they frame subjects, use negative space, or employ techniques like the rule of thirds . They might notice a tendency to fill the frame or a preference for minimalist composition s. Understanding these choices helps to refine and replicate successful compositional strategies in future shoots.EXAMINE LIGHTING AND MOODThe interplay of light and shadow in favourite photos often defines the photographer's style. They should analyse the quality, direction, and colour of light used in their best work. Some may prefer soft, diffused lighting for a calm atmosphere, while others might gravitate towards harsh, direct light for drama . The manipulation of shadows and highlights to create depth and texture is also crucial to note. By understanding their lighting preferences, photographers can consistently recreate the mood and emotional impact that resonates with their artistic vision.GETTING STARTED: EXPERIMENT WITH DIFFERENT GENRESQUICK TIPS — GETTING STARTED WITH GENRES * Explore genres: Test different types of photography—portraits, landscapes, street, product, or fashion—to learn their unique qualities. * Push your boundaries: Step outside your comfort zone with stretch goals and unfamiliar subjects to spark creativity and growth. * Notice what resonates: Pay attention to the styles and subjects that feel authentic and rewarding; use this to guide your evolving portfolio.TRY VARIOUS PHOTOGRAPHY STYLESPhotography genres serve as categories that classify the diverse world of image-making. From portraiture to photojournalism to product photography, there's a vast array of styles to explore. Each genre has its unique characteristics and techniques, encompassing composition, lighting, and post-processing methods. Photographers should learn about their options before selecting a style to focus on. Whether one's interest lies in people, animals, nature, food, or fashion, there's a type of photography geared towards that specific subject matter.PUSH YOUR CREATIVE BOUNDARIESTo develop a unique style, photographers need to challenge their assumptions and venture into unfamiliar territory. This approach can lead to innovative ideas and personal growth. By setting 'stretch' goals, such as aiming for a higher daily word count or experimenting with new mediums, photographers can expand their creative horizons. Embracing discomfort is crucial, as it often indicates that one is venturing into unknown territory where true growth happens.FIND WHAT RESONATES WITH YOUAs photographers experiment with different genres and push their boundaries, they should pay attention to what truly resonates with them . This process of self-discovery involves analysing favourite photos, identifying patterns, and understanding personal preferences. By practising consistently and mixing up their approach - sometimes shooting spontaneously, other times planning meticulously - photographers can hone their skills and develop their unique style.

By mastering these tools, they can bend them to work for their specific process and achieve a distinctive visual aesthetic.REFINE YOUR POST-PROCESSING TECHNIQUESTo refine post-processing techniques, photographers should focus on key aspects of image editing. This includes adjusting exposure, contrast, and colour balance to enhance the overall quality and impact of their images. It's crucial to maintain a balanced approach and avoid over-editing, which can make photos appear unnatural.

It involves crafting a photo story that conveys a narrative, evokes emotions, and engages the viewer. Visual storytelling is important in today's fast-paced world to grab attention and create a lasting impact.

There is something magical about freezing a moment in time, capturing the essence of a person or a place, and conveying emotions through the lens. Photography has the power to transcend language barriers and touch the hearts of people from all walks of life with its compelling narratives.WHAT IS STORYTELLING PHOTOGRAPHY?Visual storytelling in photography is a genre that goes beyond simply capturing a beautiful image. It's about crafting a photo story that conveys a narrative, evokes emotions, and engages the viewer on a deeper level. Photos that tell a story have the power to transport the viewer to a different time and place, to make them feel a range of emotions, and to leave a lasting impression with their photography.THE IMPORTANCE OF VISUAL STORYTELLINGQUICK TIPS — VISUAL STORYTELLING IN PHOTOGRAPHY * Why it matters: In a crowded visual world, storytelling makes viewers pause, connect, and remember your images. * Beyond record shots: Go deeper than “snaps” — create meaning that resonates beyond people who know the subject. * Lead with intention: Ask “what do I want the viewer to feel?” before thinking about thirds, lines, or settings. * Build narratives: Use light, environment, and subject interaction to place the viewer in the moment. * Make it immersive: Frame so the audience feels part of the scene, not just looking at it. * Find your voice: Storytelling is a personal vocabulary — your choices in framing, subject, and edit define it.Storytelling transforms photos from “what it looks like” to “what it feels like.” Create intentional, narrative images that speak beyond the moment.In today's fast-paced world, where attention spans are shorter than ever, immersive visual storytelling has become increasingly important. People are bombarded with information and images on a daily basis, and it takes something truly special to grab their attention and make them pause for a moment. Immersive storytelling through photography can do just that. It can make people stop, look, and reflect on the story being told, creating a connection between the viewer and the subject of the photograph and leaving a lasting impact.NARRATIVE PHOTOGRAPHERSSocial media is saturated with images that lack a narrative and fail to tell a story through photography. These record shots, documenting a moment, an object, a scene, or a person, often have no meaning beyond the person taking the image or the close-knit circle of people who know the photographer and the subjects. However, when infused with visual storytelling, these images can transcend immediacy and resonate more deeply with a wider audience.Creating a narrative in photography requires a much deeper connection to the photo story you want to convey. It goes beyond the rule of thirds, camera settings, or other compositional techniques and requires you to first think about the reason and intention behind the photograph. Visual storytelling places the viewer in the moment, the environment, h deeper connection to the photo story you want to convey. It goes beyond the rule of thirds, camera settings, or other compositional techniques and requires you to first think about the reason and intention behind the photograph. Visual storytelling places the viewer in the moment, the environment, and the situation to make them feel the story you are conveying. Storytelling in photography is a vocabulary that is uniquely yours to speak. Tell your photo story meaningfully, utilising the right settings and narrative techniques rather than mere references!NARRATIVE STORY TELLING PHOTOGRAPHY EXAMPLESI often create themes in my photographic framing to create photo compositions that evoke emotional photos and a narrative image. These examples of photos that tell a story hopefully place you, the viewer, into the mind of the photographer about what they see, interpret, and want to convey through visual storytelling.PHOTOGRAPHY STORYTELLING TECHNIQUESThere are several photography techniques that photographers can use to enhance their storytelling in photography. Composition techniques in photography and framing techniques are crucial, as is the use of lighting in photography to evoke different moods. By carefully choosing what to include in the frame and how to arrange the elements within it, photographers can guide the viewer's eye and convey a specific message or emotion. Editing and post-processing also play a crucial role in storytelling photography, allowing photographers to adjust colours, tones, and contrast to create a specific atmosphere and further enhance the photo composition and narrative of the image.CAPTURING EMOTIONS THROUGH VISUAL STORYTELLINGVisual storytelling through emotion photography is a profound way to encapsulate and share emotions. By capturing a fleeting moment of joy, sadness, love, or vulnerability, storytelling images allow the viewer to immerse themselves in the emotion conveyed. Photographers adept in visual storytelling focus on their subjects' expressions, gestures, and body language to distill the essence of an emotion, forging a bond with the viewer. A storytelling photograph that's executed with skill can transport the viewer into the narrative, fostering empathy and a deeper appreciation of the human condition.QUICK TIPS — STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES IN PHOTOGRAPHY * Composition & Framing: Decide what to include; arrange elements to guide the eye and support the story. * Editing & Post: Use colour, tone, and contrast adjustments to create atmosphere and reinforce narrative intent. * Emotions: Focus on expressions, gestures, and body language to capture authentic feelings that connect with viewers. * Use of Composition Rules: Apply rule of thirds, leading lines, and visual pathways to highlight the focal point. * Lighting for Mood: Soft light for intimacy, harsh shadows for drama, backlight for mystery, side light for depth. * Intentional Choices: Every frame element (light, subject, space) should serve the emotion or message you want to tell.Storytelling relies on conscious choices: composition, emotion, and light working together to immerse the viewer in the narrative you want to share.USING COMPOSITION TO ENHANCE STORYTELLING IN PHOTOGRAPHYComposition techniques are fundamental to visual storytelling in photography, involving various framing methods to create visually engaging and meaningful images. This art of photographic composition uses the viewer's natural eye movem are.USING COMPOSITION TO ENHANCE STORYTELLING IN PHOTOGRAPHYComposition techniques are fundamental to visual storytelling in photography, involving various framing methods to create visually engaging and meaningful images. This art of photographic composition uses the viewer's natural eye movement to communicate messages or emotions. By applying visual storytelling principles like the rule of thirds and visual pathways, photographers can craft a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition that highlights the photograph's focal point.THE ROLE OF LIGHTING IN NARRATIVE PHOTOGRAPHYIn the realm of visual storytelling, lighting photography plays a crucial role by influencing mood photography and enhancing the visual appeal of images. The mood and narrative of storytelling in photography are shaped by different lighting conditions, from the softness of diffused light to the intensity of dramatic shadows. Lighting techniques that manipulate the direction of light—such as front, backlighting, or side lighting—can introduce clarity, mystery, or depth to the story being told.EDITING AND POST-PROCESSING FOR STORYTELLING PHOTOGRAPHYEditing and post-processing are essential to visual storytelling in photography, as they allow photographers to fine-tune the narrative and set a specific atmospheric mood. Through the application of colour theory in photography, adjustments to colours, tones, and contrast can elicit specific emotions or highlight certain elements. Whether desaturating colours for a dramatic effect or enhancing vibrancy for energy, editing and post-processing shape the mood of the image. Retouching, a vital part of post-processing, sharpens details and eliminates distractions, ensuring the visual storytelling remains true to the intended narrative.TIPS FOR CREATING IMPACTFUL STORYTELLING IMAGESTo craft impactful storytelling photographs, photographers must blend technical proficiency with artistic vision. Capturing moments that effectively embody story composition, progression, and development is crucial for engaging visual storytelling. These storytelling elements are indispensable for photographers aiming to convey their narrative with both clarity and emotional depth. 1. Plan your shots: Before you even pick up your camera, take some time to think about the story you want to tell and how you can best capture it. Consider the location, lighting, and composition that will help convey your message. 2. Get to know your subject: Whether you are photographing people, places, or objects, take the time to understand what makes them unique and interesting. This will help you capture their essence and tell a more authentic story. 3. Be patient and observant: Sometimes the best moments happen when you least expect them. Keep your camera at the ready and be prepared to capture those fleeting moments that can make a powerful impact. 4. Experiment with different angles and perspectives: Don't be afraid to get low, climb high, or move around to find the best angle for your shot. Changing your perspective can add depth and interest to your storytelling photographs. 5. Practice, practice, practice: Like any skill, storytelling photography takes practice. Take every opportunity to hone your craft and experiment with different techniques and styles.STORYTELLING PHOTOGRAPHY IDEASFor innovative visual storytelling ideas, explore different genres, such as documentary photography or conceptual storytelling.

From early light projections to the digital revolution, the history of photography showcases human ingenuity and artistic expression. Understanding its evolution offers insight into the technology shaping modern imaging. * The Birth of Photography : The camera obscura, described by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, demonstrated how light projected an inverted image through a small hole. This concept evolved until Joseph Nicéphore Niépce captured the first permanent photograph in 1826 using heliography, requiring hours of exposure. In 1839, Louis Daguerre introduced the daguerreotype, a method that produced highly detailed images. Around the same time, William Henry Fox Talbot developed the calotype, allowing multiple prints from a single negative. * Technological Advances: The collodion wet plate process (1851) improved sharpness but required on-site development. George Eastman’s Kodak camera (1888) made photography accessible with roll film. By the 20th century, innovations like 35mm film (1925) and Kodachrome color film (1935) revolutionized documentary and artistic photography. Polaroid’s instant camera (1947) made photography even more immediate. * The Digital Age and AI Photography: Digital photography emerged in the 1970s, with Kodak engineer ntury, innovations like 35mm film (1925) and Kodachrome color film (1935) revolutionized documentary and artistic photography. Polaroid’s instant camera (1947) made photography even more immediate. * The Digital Age and AI Photography: Digital photography emerged in the 1970s, with Kodak engineer Steven Sasson inventing the first digital camera (1975). Over the next decades, digital sensors improved, leading to DSLR and mirrorless cameras. By the 2000s, digital cameras overtook film, and the iPhone (2007) brought photography to the masses. Today, AI-driven computational photography enhances images in real-time, making professional-quality photos possible on smartphones.Why Photography’s History Matters: Understanding the history of photography helps us appreciate the innovations shaping today’s technology. From early daguerreotypes to AI-powered cameras, photography continues to evolve while preserving the essence of storytelling and creativity. No matter the medium, the power of a captured moment remains timeless.----------------------------------------TIMELINE OF THE HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY: FROM INVENTION TO PRESENT DAY----------------------------------------PRE-19TH CENTURY: THE FOUNDATIONS📌 4th Century BCE – Aristotle and ancient Chinese philosophers describe the camera obscura, an optical device that projects an inverted image of a scene.4TH CENTURY BCEThe Camera Obscura, described by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, laid the foundation for photography. This optical marvel projected an inverted image through a small hole, but it lacked permanence. While it allowed for detailed observation, image quality was fleeting—no resolution, no pixels, just ephemeral light on a surface, awaiting the invention that could truly capture a moment.----------------------------------------16TH CENTURY – THE ARTIST’S TOOL: CAMERA OBSCURA REFINEMENT📌 16th Century – Artists use the camera obscura for accurate perspective drawing.By the 16th century, artists refined the camera obscura, using it to trace accurate compositions. Though still ephemeral, it improved clarity and sharpness, offering a pinhole-like projection of reality. However, it remained a fleeting vision—no pixels, no permanence, just light cast onto a surface, awaiting a means of preservation.----------------------------------------19TH CENTURY: THE BIRTH OF PHOTOGRAPHY1826–1827 – THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH: NIÉPCE’S HELIOGRAPH📌 1826–1827 – Joseph Nicéphore Niépce creates the first permanent photograph, \"View from the Window at Le Gras,\" using a process called heliography with a bitumen-coated plate.Joseph Nicéphore Niépce created the first permanent photograph using a bitumen-coated plate, exposed for hours in direct sunlight. The result was crude—low contrast, grainy, and barely legible—yet revolutionary. This was the dawn of captured imagery, a faint, textured imprint of reality, akin to a primitive, ultra-low-resolution monochrome print.1839 – DAGUERREOTYPE: A NEW LEVEL OF DETAIL📌 1839 – Louis Daguerre invents the daguerreotype, the first publicly announced photographic process, producing a highly detailed, single-image on a silver-plated copper sheet.📌 1839 – The term \"photography\" is coined by Sir John Herschel, derived from the Greek words for \"light\" (phos) and \"drawing\" (graphe).Louis Daguerre introduced the daguerreotype, producing astonishing detail on a silver-plated copper sheet. While a single image only, its clarity f copper sheet.📌 1839 – The term \"photography\" is coined by Sir John Herschel, derived from the Greek words for \"light\" (phos) and \"drawing\" (graphe).Louis Daguerre introduced the daguerreotype, producing astonishing detail on a silver-plated copper sheet. While a single image only, its clarity far surpassed Niépce’s work. Shadows and highlights emerged with depth, resembling a high-contrast black-and-white print—sharp but fragile, the first true glimpse of the world preserved in photographic form.1841 – CALOTYPE: THE BIRTH OF NEGATIVES📌 1841 – William Henry Fox Talbot patents the calotype, an early paper-based negative-positive process, allowing multiple prints.William Henry Fox Talbot developed the calotype, pioneering the negative-positive process. Unlike the daguerreotype, this allowed for multiple prints, but images appeared softer, with less contrast. The detail was decent—think early film grain rather than crisp edges—a vital step toward modern photography but still distant from the fine detail seen today.1851 – WET PLATE COLLODION: A LEAP IN SHARPNESS📌 1851 – Frederick Scott Archer develops the collodion wet plate process, dramatically reducing exposure times and improving image sharpness.Frederick Scott Archer introduced the collodion wet plate, drastically improving image quality. Compared to calotypes, this offered sharper details and richer contrast, akin to moving from soft-focus film to razor-sharp monochrome prints. However, it required complex handling, making it a tool for dedicated photographers rather than everyday users.1888 – KODAK’S ROLL FILM REVOLUTION📌 1888 – George Eastman introduces the Kodak camera, revolutionizing photography with roll film and the slogan “You press the button, we do the rest.”George Eastman’s Kodak camera changed everything: roll film meant photography for all. While image quality was softer than glass plate photography, it introduced portability. Resolution was comparable to early compact film cameras—grainy yet recognisable, marking the birth of mass-market photography with the iconic slogan: “You press the button, we do the rest.”1895 – THE FIRST X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH: SEEING BEYOND LIGHT📌 1895 – Wilhelm Röntgen takes the first X-ray photograph, expanding photography beyond the visible spectrum.Wilhelm Röntgen captured the first X-ray image, revealing a hidden world beneath the skin. Unlike traditional photography, this produced stark, ghostly skeletal images with extreme contrast—a precursor to medical imaging rather than artistic photography, but still a major milestone in the evolution of photographic technology.----------------------------------------20TH CENTURY: THE RISE OF MODERN PHOTOGRAPHY1907 – AUTOCHROME LUMIÈRE: THE FIRST COLOUR PROCESS📌 1907 – The first commercially available color process, Autochrome Lumière, is introduced.The Lumière brothers introduced Autochrome Lumière, bringing colour photography to life. Unlike modern vibrant images, early Autochrome prints were muted, grainy, and dreamlike, similar to a hand-tinted postcard rather than true-to-life colour. Though revolutionary, it lacked the crisp, saturated hues seen in later film photography.1925 – THE LEICA I: PIONEERING 35MM PHOTOGRAPHY📌 1913 – The Leitz Camera (Leica) is developed, pioneering 35mm photography and portability.📌 1925 – The Leica I is released, becoming the standard for 35mm photography.The release of the Leica I changed photography fo later film photography.1925 – THE LEICA I: PIONEERING 35MM PHOTOGRAPHY📌 1913 – The Leitz Camera (Leica) is developed, pioneering 35mm photography and portability.📌 1925 – The Leica I is released, becoming the standard for 35mm photography.The release of the Leica I changed photography forever. Compact, discreet, and fast, it made high-quality street and reportage photography possible. Compared to larger formats, resolution was lower but sharp enough for publication—like stepping from a large plate camera to a sleek, full-frame DSLR equivalent for its time.1935 – KODACHROME: THE FIRST WIDELY AVAILABLE COLOUR FILM📌 1935 – Kodachrome film is introduced, the first widely available color film.Kodachrome brought rich, vivid colour to mainstream photography. Compared to Autochrome, it offered greater sharpness and tonal depth, akin to stepping from a faded pastel to a high-quality film scan. For decades, it remained the benchmark for colour photography, with deep blacks, fine grain, and a timeless, cinematic quality.1947 – POLAROID INSTANT PHOTOGRAPHY: IMMEDIATE RESULTS📌 1947 – Polaroid introduces instant photography, invented by Edwin Land, with the first instant camera arriving in 1948.Edwin Land’s Polaroid gave photographers instant gratification. Early prints were soft, with limited dynamic range, like an early inkjet photo compared to a high-resolution film print. Yet, it revolutionised photography, offering a snapshot of life in real-time, making it the precursor to today’s instant digital sharing.1957 – THE FIRST DIGITAL IMAGE: THE PIXEL IS BORN📌 1957 – The first digital image is created by Russell Kirsch, scanning a black-and-white photograph into a computer.The first digital image, scanned in 1957, was only 176x176 pixels—a far cry from today’s megapixel standards. It was grainy, low contrast, and monochrome, much like an early fax image. Yet, it marked the birth of digital photography, proving that images could exist outside of film and paper.1963 – KODAK INSTAMATIC: SIMPLICITY FOR THE MASSES📌 1963 – Kodak introduces Instamatic cameras, making photography accessible to a mass audience.The Kodak Instamatic made photography easier than ever, with a point-and-shoot simplicity that mimicked today's smartphone cameras. Image quality was acceptable but unrefined, like a disposable film camera print—grainy, soft, but perfectly suited for casual photography.1975 – THE FIRST DIGITAL CAMERA: A NEW ERA BEGINS📌 1975 – Steven Sasson at Kodak invents the first digital camera, capturing a 0.01-megapixel image on a cassette tape.Steven Sasson’s prototype digital camera captured an image at 0.01 megapixels (100x100 pixels), recording onto a cassette tape. The result? Blurry, blocky, and nearly unrecognisable compared to film, but the concept was game-changing—a true first step into a pixel-based future.1981 – SONY MAVICA: THE FIRST ELECTRONIC STILL CAMERA📌 1981 – Sony releases the Mavica, the first electronic still camera, storing images digitally but displaying them on a screen.The Sony Mavica introduced electronic still photography, but resolution was still weak—think early VGA computer graphics (0.3 megapixels), with washed-out tones and limited dynamic range. Still, it set the stage for true digital cameras.1987 – CANON EOS: AUTOFOCUS REINVENTED📌 1987 – Canon introduces the EOS system, marking the transition to modern autofocus SLRs.Canon’s EOS system revolutionised ter graphics (0.3 megapixels), with washed-out tones and limited dynamic range. Still, it set the stage for true digital cameras.1987 – CANON EOS: AUTOFOCUS REINVENTED📌 1987 – Canon introduces the EOS system, marking the transition to modern autofocus SLRs.Canon’s EOS system revolutionised photography, integrating fast, accurate autofocus. This marked a shift towards modern DSLRs, with image quality comparable to high-end film cameras—sharp, detailed, and professional-grade.1991 – KODAK DCS-100: THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL DIGITAL SLR📌 1991 – Kodak launches the first professional digital SLR, the DCS-100, at 1.3 megapixels.At 1.3 megapixels, the Kodak DCS-100 delivered a huge leap in digital quality. Compared to film, it was still lacking in resolution and dynamic range, but it proved digital SLRs could compete in professional settings.----------------------------------------21ST CENTURY: THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION & AI PHOTOGRAPHY2000 – THE FIRST CAMERA PHONE: A LOW-RES REVOLUTION📌 2000 – Sharp introduces the first camera phone, the J-SH04, starting the era of mobile photography.The Sharp J-SH04 introduced mobile photography with a 0.1-megapixel sensor. Quality was extremely low—pixelated and washed-out, akin to a basic webcam image, but it laid the foundation for the smartphone revolution.2004 – THE FALL OF FILM: DIGITAL TAKES OVER📌 2004 – Film camera production declines significantly as digital cameras overtake film in sales.By 2004, digital camera sales overtook film, marking the true transition to the digital era. Early digital compact cameras offered 3-5 megapixels, close to 35mm film in resolution but lacking its depth and richness.2007 – THE IPHONE: A POCKET CAMERA REVOLUTION📌 2007 – Apple launches the first iPhone, revolutionizing smartphone photography and leading to the rise of social media-driven photography.The first iPhone had a 2-megapixel camera, far below DSLRs but a step beyond early camera phones. Image quality was basic—like an entry-level compact camera, yet it marked the beginning of photography’s shift to always-on connectivity.2012 – THE RISE OF MIRRORLESS CAMERAS📌 2012 – Mirrorless cameras gain popularity, challenging DSLRs with compact designs and high performance.With compact bodies and DSLR-quality sensors, mirrorless cameras like the Sony NEX-7 proved that portability didn’t mean sacrificing image quality.

Hot shoe bubble level: Ensures the camera is perfectly level, saving time in post-production. 2. Tilt-shift lens: Allows for perspective control and minimises the keystoning effect in architectural shots. 3. Cam Ranger: Enables remote viewing and control of the camera via a tablet or smartphone, useful for complex setups.By investing in these essential pieces of photography gear and photographer equipment, beginners can lay a solid foundation for their architectural photography journey, enabling them to capture stunning images of buildings and structures with precision and creativity.MASTERING COMPOSITION TECHNIQUESQUICK TIPS — COMPOSITION * Rule of Thirds: Place buildings or features along grid lines to create balance. * Leading Lines: Use roads, staircases, or beams to draw the viewer’s eye toward your subject. * Symmetry: Highlight reflections, windows, or repeated elements for strong visual rhythm. * Patterns: Focus on repetition and geometry; break a pattern to create a focal point.Mastering composition techniques is essential for creating compelling architectural photographs. By understanding and applying these principles, photographers can guide the viewer's eye and create visually striking images that showcase the beauty of buildings and structures.RULE OF THIRDSThe rule of thirds is a fundamental composition technique that can significantly enhance architectural photographs. This principle involves dividing the image into a 3x3 grid and placing key elements along the lines or at their intersections. By positioning important architectural features at these points, photographers can create more balanced and dynamic compositions.To apply the rule of thirds effectively: 1. Activate the grid feature on your camera or smartphone. 2. Place the main subject or focal point at one of the intersection points. 3. Align horizontal elements, such as horizons or building edges, along the horizontal grid lines. 4. Position vertical elements, such as columns or doorways, along the vertical grid lines.LEADING LINESLeading lines are powerful compositional elements that guide the viewer's eye through the photograph towards the main subject. In architectural photography, these lines can be found in various forms, such as roads, staircases, or structural elements of buildings.To incorporate leading lines effectively: 1. Identify natural or man-made lines in the scene that lead towards the main architectural subject. 2. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to emphasise these lines. 3. Use diagonal lines to create a sense of energy and movement in the image. 4. Look for converging lines that draw attention to a vanishing point, adding depth to the composition.SYMMETRY AND PATTERNSSymmetry and patterns are abundant in architecture, offering photographers numerous opportunities to create visually striking images. Symmetrical compositions can conv ttention to a vanishing point, adding depth to the composition.SYMMETRY AND PATTERNSSymmetry and patterns are abundant in architecture, offering photographers numerous opportunities to create visually striking images. Symmetrical compositions can convey a sense of harmony and balance, while patterns can add rhythm and visual interest to a photograph.To capture symmetry and patterns effectively: 1. Look for reflective surfaces, such as glass facades or water features, to create mirror-like symmetry. 2. Seek out repetitive elements in building designs, such as windows, arches, or columns. 3. Use a central composition to emphasise perfect symmetry in a building's facade. 4. Experiment with breaking patterns by including a contrasting element to add visual interest.By mastering these composition techniques, photographers can elevate their architectural images, creating visually compelling photographs that showcase the beauty and intricacy of buildings and structures.WORKING WITH LIGHT AND EXPOSUREQUICK TIPS — LIGHT & EXPOSURE * Golden Hour: Warm light adds texture and depth to facades. * Blue Hour: Capture contrast between cool skies and illuminated buildings. * HDR: Bracket exposures for high-contrast scenes; blend carefully to stay natural. * Long Exposures: Blur clouds, water, or traffic to add movement against static architecture.GOLDEN HOUR AND BLUE HOURThe golden hour occurs twice daily, offering photographers a unique opportunity to capture stunning architectural images. In the morning, it begins when the Sun is at -4º elevation and ends when it reaches 6º above the horizon. In the evening, it starts at 6º elevation and concludes at -4º. During this time, the sky transitions from red and orange to golden tones, creating a warm color temperature. The light is soft, diffused, and has little contrast, making it ideal for exterior photography and interior photography.The blue hour, occurring just before sunrise and after sunset, provides a different aesthetic. It begins when the Sun is at -6º elevation and ends at -4º. During this period, the sky has a deep blue hue with a cold color temperature and saturated colors. The soft, cool light creates a striking contrast with illuminated buildings and streetlights, perfect for urban landscapes.HDR PHOTOGRAPHYHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) photography has become a valuable technique in architectural photography. It allows photographers to capture a wider range of tones in high-contrast scenes. By merging multiple exposures, HDR can reveal details in both highlights and shadows that might be lost in a single exposure.To create an HDR image, photographers can use post-processing software like Lightroom's \"HDR Merge\" feature. This tool combines bracketed exposures into a single HDR file while preserving raw information. The resulting DNG file can be edited as a single raw file, offering greater flexibility in post-processing.LONG EXPOSURESLong exposure photography has an influence on the creation of unique architectural images. It allows photographers to capture movement in clouds and water, adding a dynamic element to static structures. This technique requires neutral density filters to reduce the amount of light entering the lens, enabling longer exposure times.When shooting long exposures, a sturdy tripod is es mages. It allows photographers to capture movement in clouds and water, adding a dynamic element to static structures. This technique requires neutral density filters to reduce the amount of light entering the lens, enabling longer exposure times.When shooting long exposures, a sturdy tripod is essential to ensure sharp images. Photographers should also consider using a remote shutter release to minimise camera shake. The \"Long Exposure Softbox Effect\" occurs when passing clouds filter the light during long exposures, resulting in softer, dreamier images compared to short exposures.POST-PROCESSING TIPS FOR ARCHITECTURAL IMAGESQUICK TIPS — POST-PROCESSING * Correct Perspective: Fix converging verticals using lens correction tools or software. * Balance Light: Adjust highlights and shadows to reveal details without over-editing. * Enhance Details: Apply selective sharpening/clarity to materials like brick, glass, or stone. * Maintain a natural look: — keep colours realistic and lines straight for credibility.CORRECTING PERSPECTIVEPost-processing plays a crucial role in refining architectural photographs. One common issue photographers face is the keystoning effect, where buildings appear to lean backwards. To correct this, photographers can use perspective correction tools in post-processing software like Adobe Lightroom. The 'Transform' panel offers options such as 'Auto', 'Vertical', 'Full', and 'Guided'. For precise adjustments, the 'Guided' option allows users to draw lines along vertical edges, automatically correcting the perspective.Alternatively, tilt-shift lenses offer an in-camera solution, allowing photographers to capture images with correct verticals without tilting the camera. While these lenses are expensive and lack zoom functionality, they save time for professional architectural photographers who prioritise getting it right in-camera.BALANCING LIGHT AND SHADOWSBalancing light is essential in architectural photography, especially for interior photography. This process involves capturing multiple exposures to correctly expose both bright and dark areas. When blending these images, it's crucial to address color calibration differences between artificial indoor lighting equipment and natural daylight.To achieve a balanced result: 1. Adjust exposure to reveal details in highlights and shadows. 2. Manage contrast to maintain depth without sacrificing natural appearance. 3. Correct colour casts caused by varying light sources. 4. Adjust the white balance for a neutral, realistic representation.ENHANCING DETAILSTo bring out the best in architectural images, photographers can employ several techniques to enhance details: 1. Use selective sharpening to highlight fine architectural details without creating an unnatural appearance. 2. Adjust clarity and texture settings to enhance the tactile quality of surfaces. 3. Apply colour adjustments to bring out subtle hues in materials. 4. Utilise adjustment layers for non-destructive editing, allowing for fine-tuning of colour and exposure.By carefully applying these post-processing techniques, photographers can create compelling architectural images that accurately represent the space while maintaining a natural and authentic appearance.ARCHITECTURE PHOTOGRAPHY — ROADMAP * Getting Started: Move beyond snapshots — scout light, space, and context.

Exposure bracketing helps you overcome limited dynamic range by taking multiple exposures and blending them for a balanced result. This guide explains the technique and when to use it for better images.3 key takeaways * Understand: What exposure bracketing is and how it works with your camera’s auto settings. * Apply: When to bracket — sunsets, backlit scenes, interiors with windows, or high-contrast landscapes. * Enhance: How to merge bracketed shots in editing software for natural-looking HDR results.Table of Contents ShowSUMMARYExposure bracketing is a technique used by photographers to capture a series of shots with varying exposure settings. It helps overcome the limitations of a camera's dynamic range and ensures well-exposed images in challenging lighting conditions.There are two methods of exposure bracketing: manual and auto. Manual bracketing provides complete control over exposure settings, while auto bracketing automatically adjusts settings for each shot. To use bracketing effectively, assess the scene, set the camera to bracketing mode, choose the appropriate exposure mode, focus and compose the shot, capture the series, and review the histogram.Using a tripod, remote shutter release, shooting in RAW format, and experimenting with compositions can en use bracketing effectively, assess the scene, set the camera to bracketing mode, choose the appropriate exposure mode, focus and compose the shot, capture the series, and review the histogram.Using a tripod, remote shutter release, shooting in RAW format, and experimenting with compositions can enhance the results. Overlapping exposures can limit dynamic range and reduce the effectiveness of exposure bracketing. Exposure bracketing works best for stationary subjects, as moving subjects may result in inconsistencies and ghosting. Post-processing is necessary to achieve the desired final result. Cameras that support exposure bracketing include DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. Mastering exposure bracketing enhances the quality of images.----------------------------------------EXPOSURE BRACKETING: A GUIDE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS'CAPTURING THE PERFECT SHOT HAS NEVER BEEN EASIER WITH THE TECHNIQUE OF PHOTOGRAPHY EXPOSURE BRACKETING.'With the ever-improving technology of camera sensors and their ability to deal with high dynamic range scenes in photography, I want to share my 20 years of first-hand experience and my change in approach to exposure bracketing.Traditionally, I used graduated neutral density filters to deal with the most challenging situations. However, my approach has changed over the last five years as sensor technology has improved dramatically, and photo editing software has, too. These days (the last few years in fact) I rarely use graduated filters to balance the exposure and dynamic range - Not to say that I think this is not best practice, as there are still advantages to using grads rather than bracketing. However, bracketing exposures has meant less gear in my kit bag and generally decent results once I import the images into photo editing software to blend them.This post explains what exposure bracketing is and how to do it.WHAT IS BRACKETING?Photography bracketing, also known as exposure bracketing, is a technique extensively used by photographers to capture a series of shots of the same subject, each with varying exposure settings. This method involves making a sequence of images, where each photo is fine-tuned to have a slightly different exposure, ensuring that the sequence captures the full range of light and shadow. By mastering photography bracketing, photographers significantly enhance their chances of producing a well-exposed image, especially in challenging lighting conditions with prominent shadows and highlights. This technique is used extensively in landscape and property interior photography.Modern cameras also feature a focus bracketing mode that allows for multiple focus points to create the perfect depth of field tailored to their photography style.QUICK TIPS — WHAT IS EXPOSURE BRACKETING? * Bracketing means taking a sequence of shots at different exposures. * Usually 3–5 frames: one exposed normally, one darker, one brighter. * It helps capture detail in scenes with high contrast or tricky light. * Final images can be chosen individually or merged for HDR editing.WHAT IS SENSOR DYNAMIC RANGE?UNDERSTANDING CAMERA SENSOR DYNAMIC RANGEThe dynamic range of a camera sensor refers to its ability to capture and reproduce a wide range of tones in an image, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. It is a critical factor in determining the quality of an image, especially in high-contrast scenes.Components of NAMIC RANGEThe dynamic range of a camera sensor refers to its ability to capture and reproduce a wide range of tones in an image, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. It is a critical factor in determining the quality of an image, especially in high-contrast scenes.Components of Dynamic Range * Shadows: The ability to capture details in the darkest parts of an image without losing important information. * Highlights: The capacity to retain detail in the brightest areas of an image without overexposing or blowing out the highlights. * Tonal Gradation: The smooth transition of tones between shadows, midtones, and highlights.View fullsizeImportance of Dynamic Range * Image Quality: A wider dynamic range allows for more detail and subtlety in the captured image. * Versatility: It enables photographers to capture scenes with high contrast and challenging lighting conditions more effectively. * Post-Processing Flexibility: Images with a good dynamic range offer more latitude for adjustments in post-processing without sacrificing quality.Measurement and Specification * Dynamic range is typically measured in \"stops\" or \"EV\" (exposure values). * Camera manufacturers often specify the dynamic range of their sensors in their technical specifications.Improving Dynamic Range * Sensor Technology: Advancements in sensor design and technology contribute to improving dynamic range. * HDR Techniques: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging techniques can be used to combine multiple exposures to extend the dynamic range captured in a single image.Understanding camera sensor dynamic range is essential for photographers and videographers as it directly impacts the quality and versatility of the images and videos they capture. As sensor technology continues to advance, improvements in dynamic range contribute to the overall advancement of imaging capabilities.INTERACTIVE: EXPOSURE CALCULATOROpen full screen or open in a new tab WHY IS EXPOSURE BRACKETING IMPORTANT FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS?For photographers, mastering the art of bracketing is crucial as it enables them to surpass the limitations of their camera's dynamic range. The dynamic range is the spectrum of light intensities from shadows to highlights that the camera sensor can faithfully record. In high-contrast scenarios, such as landscape photography with a luminous sky and a shadowy foreground, capturing details in both extremes of light and shadow can be daunting. However, exposure bracketing empowers photographers to capture a gamut of exposures, from bright to dark, ensuring that the final image retains the intricate contrast details. See my previous post on dynamic range and using graduated filters DIFFERENT METHODS OF EXPOSURE BRACKETINGThere are two main methods of exposure bracketing: manual exposure bracketing and auto exposure bracketing. Manual exposure bracketing requires the photographer to manually tweak the exposure settings between each shot, providing meticulous control. Conversely, auto exposure bracketing permits the camera to automatically alter the osure bracketing: manual exposure bracketing and auto exposure bracketing. Manual exposure bracketing requires the photographer to manually tweak the exposure settings between each shot, providing meticulous control. Conversely, auto exposure bracketing permits the camera to automatically alter the exposure settings for each image in the sequence, simplifying the task of obtaining a variety of photographs.MANUAL EXPOSURE BRACKETINGManual exposure bracketing offers photographers complete command over their camera's exposure settings. To start manual exposure bracketing, one must switch the camera to manual mode. Then, a series of photographs is captured, with each one slightly altering the exposure settings by changing the shutter speed, aperture, or ISO. Exposure compensation can also be employed to fine-tune the results in Aperture or Shutter priority modes.WHAT IS EXPOSURE COMPENSATIONExposure compensation, a feature present on most digital cameras, allows users to modify the exposure determined by the camera's light meter. It's used to either brighten or darken the exposure from the camera's suggested value and is typically adjusted in increments known as 'stops.' This function is particularly useful when the camera's automatic metering settings fail to represent the desired lighting accurately or when capturing scenes in challenging lighting conditions. Remember the camera light meter is attempting to expose pixels towards 18% Grey (mid grey) so, scenes with large amounts of black or white can cause the metered exposure to be under or over exposed.How Exposure Compensation Works * Exposure compensation allows the photographer to override the camera's automatic metered exposure settings. * It is often used to correct for predominantly dark or light scenes, such as snowy landscapes or backlit subjects. * By adjusting the exposure compensation, the photographer can ensure that the final image is properly exposed according to their creative vision.Using Exposure Compensation * To use exposure compensation, the photographer typically needs to access the camera's exposure compensation setting, usually denoted by a \"+/-\" symbol or AV button. * Adjusting the setting to a positive value increases the exposure, making the image brighter, while a negative value decreases the exposure, making the image darker. * The specific steps for adjusting exposure compensation vary depending on the camera model, so it's important to consult the camera's manual for detailed instructions. Generally, the increments are 0.3 (1/3rd) of a stop.Importance of Exposure Compensation * Exposure compensation is valuable when the camera's automatic metering settings may not accurately capture the desired exposure. * It gives photographers more creative control over the final image and helps them achieve the intended exposure in challenging lighting conditions.Photographers who favour meticulous control over their camera's exposure settings often choose manual exposure bracketing. While this method is precise, it entails the risk of variations in the scene's light or moving subjects due to the time elapsed between each frame.AUTOMATIC EXPOSURE BRACKETING - AEBQUICK TIPS — HOW TO DO EXPOSURE BRACKETING * Enable Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) in your camera’s menu if available. * Choose ±1 or ±2 stops difference depending on scene contrast. * Use continuous shooting mode so the camera fires the full bracket in one burst. * S XPOSURE BRACKETING - AEBQUICK TIPS — HOW TO DO EXPOSURE BRACKETING * Enable Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) in your camera’s menu if available. * Choose ±1 or ±2 stops difference depending on scene contrast. * Use continuous shooting mode so the camera fires the full bracket in one burst. * Stabilise with a tripod for best alignment; handheld works if light is good. * Merge bracketed shots in software (Lightroom, Photoshop) for balanced HDR.Auto exposure bracketing provides a more streamlined approach to bracketing, where the camera automatically adjusts the exposure settings for each shot in the series. This feature is especially beneficial for capturing scenes with rapidly changing light conditions or moving subjects. Most modern cameras come with an auto exposure bracketing function that can be easily activated through the camera's menu, simplifying the process of taking a series of bracketed photographs.5 exposures set 1.3 stops apart with the metered calculation set to -1.7HOW TO USE BRACKETING IN PHOTOGRAPHY EFFECTIVELYTo use photo bracketing effectively, follow these steps: 1. Assess the scene: Before starting your bracketed series, evaluate the lighting conditions and dynamic range of the scene. This will help you determine the number of shots and the range of exposures needed. Alternatively a histogram with a spike at both ends of the graph indicating that the shadows have turned to black and the highlights have turned to white is a sure sign that you need to bracket the exposure. 2. You can quickly measure the difference between the brightest and darkest points in the frame by taking a spot metering measurement and then calculating the difference in the stops of light to work out the dynamic range required. 3. Set your camera to automatic bracketing mode: Access the bracketing settings on your camera and choose the number of shots and the exposure increments you want. This will vary depending on the camera model, so consult your camera's manual for specific instructions. Most modern DSLR cameras will do a minimum of three bracketed exposures with up to three stops of light difference. -3, 0, +3. More sophisticated cameras allow you to take more than three exposures, each with a greater range of stops between them if required. Some cameras also require you to switch drive mode to continuous shooting to ensure when you press and hold the shutter release down, all exposures fire automatically in sequential quick succession. 4. Choose the appropriate exposure mode: Depending on the shooting situation, select the appropriate one, such as aperture priority, shutter priority, or manual mode. This will allow you to control specific exposure settings while the camera adjusts the others. 5. Focus and compose your shot: Set your focus and compose your shot before initiating the bracketed series. This will ensure that each shot in the series captures the subject in the desired way. 6. Capture the bracketed series: Press and hold the shutter button to capture the bracketed series of shots. Make sure to keep the camera steady to avoid any blurring between shots. You may need a tripod if the exposure time between shots is slower than you can hold the camera steady to avoid ghosting or out of focus objects. 7. Review and check the histogram for the darkest shot to confirm the highlights (brightest part) of the image are not over-exposed, and check the histogram for the brightest image to check that the darkest p",

Grasping the nuances of exposure allows photographers to articulate their stories precisely how they envision, turning fleeting moments into timeless art.This article delves into the essential aspects of what is exposure photography, including the exposure triangle—shutter speed, aperture, and ISO—and how these elements interact to affect the outcome of a photograph. In the journey towards photographic excellence, understanding and balancing these elements for the perfect shot is a skill that evolves with practice and patience. Further, we will explore practical tips for mastering exposure, empowering photographers to elevate their craft. Whether a novice in photography or someone looking to refine their skills, this guide aims to illuminate the path toward achieving expressive and impactful photographs through optimal exposure.WHAT IS EXPOSURE IN PHOTOGRAPHY?The exposure meaning in photography is a fundamental concept that determines how light or dark an image will appear. It is defined as the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor or film during the process of taking a photo. This exposure is controlled through the camera's aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings, each playing a pivotal role in the final outcome of the photograph.When a photographer presses the shutter button, the camera's aperture opens, allowing light to enter and hit the sensor, creating the image. The duration this aperture remains open is known as the shutter speed, and it can vary from fractions of a second to several hours, depending on the desired effect. The ISO setting, on the other hand, adjusts the sensor's sensitivity to light. Together, these elements form the exposure triangle, which is critical to mastering in order to achieve well-exposed photos.Achieving the right exposure is a balancing act. Overexposure occurs when too much light is allowed into the camera, leading to washed-out, overly bright images with lost details in highlights. Underexposure, conversely, results in overly dark images where shadow details are lost. Understanding how to manipulate shutter speed, aperture, and ISO is essential for photographers to control the exposure effectively.It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all setting for perfect exposure. Each shooting scenario might require different settings based on lighting conditions and the creative vision of the photographer. The key to mastering exposure lies in understanding the interplay between these three settings and how they affect the overall brightness and aesthetic of the photo. This understanding allows photographers to not just capture images with correct brightness but also to infuse them with a sense of depth and sharpness, making each photograph a true representation of the scene as envisioned.THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLE: SHUTTER SPEED, APERTURE, AND ISOUNDERSTANDING SHUTTER SPEEDShutter speed is a crucial component of the exposure triangle, influencing both the brightness and the artistic expression of your photos. It refers to the length of time the camera's shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Shutter speeds can range from very fast (1/8000 second) to very slow (30 seconds), each serving a different purpose. Fast shutter speeds are essential for freezing motion, capturing sharp images of fast-moving subjects like sports or e camera's shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Shutter speeds can range from very fast (1/8000 second) to very slow (30 seconds), each serving a different purpose. Fast shutter speeds are essential for freezing motion, capturing sharp images of fast-moving subjects like sports or wildlife. Conversely, slow shutter speeds allow more light into the camera, ideal for low-light conditions or creating effects such as motion blur in flowing water or bustling city scenes. Long exposure photography can create stunning effects by capturing motion over an extended period of time.UNDERSTANDING APERTUREAperture refers to the size of the opening in the lens through which light passes. It is expressed in f-numbers such as f/1.4, f/2.8, etc. A larger aperture (smaller f-number) allows more light to reach the camera sensor, which is beneficial in low-light conditions and also creates a shallow depth of field. This effect beautifully blurs the background while keeping the subject in sharp focus, commonly used in portrait photography. On the other hand, a smaller aperture (larger f-number) lets in less light, which is useful for achieving a greater depth of field where more of the scene is in focus, ideal for landscape photography.UNDERSTANDING ISOISO measures the sensitivity of the camera's sensor to light. Lower ISO settings (e.g., 100 or 200) will produce sharper, clearer images with minimal noise, perfect for conditions with adequate lighting. Higher ISO settings are used in darker environments to capture more light but at the cost of increased noise, which can affect the image quality. Balancing ISO with shutter speed and aperture is key to obtaining the best possible exposure for your photographs. For instance, if shooting in a dimly lit room without a flash, you might increase the ISO to 800 or higher to capture the scene without motion blur.Each element of the exposure triangle — shutter speed, aperture, and ISO — interacts intricately with the others. Adjusting one requires compensation with the others to maintain the desired exposure and effect. Mastery of these settings empowers photographers to take creative control over their images, moving beyond automatic exposure modes to fully manual, where the true artistry of photography can flourish.BALANCING EXPOSURE FOR THE PERFECT SHOTAchieving the perfect exposure in photography is both an art and a science, requiring photographers to adeptly balance the elements of the exposure triangle—shutter speed, aperture (f-stop), and ISO. This balance ensures that the image brightness aligns with the scene being photographed, avoiding underexposure or overexposure while also allowing for creative control over visual image attributes such as motion blur, depth of field, and image noise.⚡ QUICK EXPOSURE TIPS * Think in stops of light: doubling or halving exposure comes from aperture, shutter or ISO changes. * Start with aperture or shutter priority to control depth of field or motion, then balance ISO. * Check your histogram instead of just the LCD — it reveals hidden clipping in shadows or highlights. * Use exposure compensation (+/–) to quickly correct metering bias. * Bracket exposures in tricky light — it gives insurance for post-processing.Suggested settings by sceneScene Starting point Why Tip Bright daylight f/8, 1/250s, ISO 100 Balanced exposure with depth of field Use apertur ights. * Use exposure compensation (+/–) to quickly correct metering bias. * Bracket exposures in tricky light — it gives insurance for post-processing.Suggested settings by sceneScene Starting point Why Tip Bright daylight f/8, 1/250s, ISO 100 Balanced exposure with depth of field Use aperture for sharp landscapes Shade / overcast f/4, 1/125s, ISO 400 Compensates for lower light Watch for camera shake Indoors (no flash) f/2.8, 1/60s, ISO 800 Keeps exposure without flash Stabilise or use faster lens Moving subjects f/4, 1/1000s, ISO 1600 Freezes action Use shutter priority Night street f/2, 1/60s, ISO 3200 Balances low light hand-held Expose for highlights Astrophotography f/2.8, 20s, ISO 3200 Stars visible without trails Use 500-rule; tripod essential Tripod landscapes f/11, 1/4s, ISO 100 Max sharpness and quality Drag shutter as neededINTERACTIVE: EXPOSURE CALCULATOROpen full screen or open in a new tab EXPOSURE COMPENSATIONExposure compensation is a crucial tool that allows photographers to adjust the camera's default metering to better suit the specifics of the scene being captured. This feature is particularly useful in tricky lighting conditions where the camera's light meter might misinterpret the brightness of the scene, such as snowy landscapes or backlit subjects. By manually adjusting the exposure compensation, photographers can either increase (+EV) or decrease (-EV) the exposure based on the scene's actual luminance, thus ensuring the final image accurately reflects the desired outcome. Whether using aperture priority, shutter priority, or program mode, this adjustment helps in fine-tuning the exposure without altering the chosen depth of field or motion blur effects set by the aperture and shutter speed.USING THE HISTOGRAM TO MEASURE EXPOSUREThe histogram is an invaluable graphical representation that shows the tonal distribution in an image, from the darkest shadows to the brightest highlights. Understanding how to read the histogram helps photographers make informed decisions about exposure adjustments. A well-balanced histogram typically has a bell-shaped curve without clipping at either end, indicating no loss of detail in the shadows and highlights. However, if the histogram is skewed too far to the left or right, it suggests underexposure or overexposure, respectively. Photographers can use this information to recalibrate their camera settings, ensuring that the exposure aligns more closely with the visualized outcome of the image. For instance, if the histogram peaks towards the highlights (right side), reducing the exposure by adjusting the shutter speed, aperture, or ISO can help bring back details in the bright areas.By mastering exposure compensation and effectively utilising the histogram, photographers achieve optimal exposure and enhance their creative expression, capturing visually compelling and technically sound images.GRAB THE 1-PAGE EXPOSURE FIELD CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 guide — ISO · Aperture · Shutter · Do/Don’t · quick exercises.Download Exposure Field Checklist (PDF) See All Lesson Options & Packages Prefer a text link? Download the Exposure Field Checklist (PDF) PRACTICAL TIPS FOR MASTERING EXPOSUREMastering exposure in photography is essential for capturing high-quality images that resonate with both the photographer's intent and the viewer's perception. Here, we provide practical tips and highlight common mistakes to help photographers enhance their skills in managing exposure.RECOMMENDED SETTINGS FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOSEach photographic scenario demands specific settings to achieve the desired exposure. For instance, landscapes often benefit from a deep depth of field, which can be achieved by using smaller apertures like f/11 or f/13. This setting ensures that both the foreground and background remain sharp, capturing the vastness and detail of the scene.In contrast, portrait photography may require a shallow depth of field to focus attention on the subject. Using wider apertures, such as f/1.4 or f/4, helps blur the background and highlight the subject. This technique is particularly effective in making the subject stand out against a busy backdrop. Low key photography, which emphasizes shadows and dark tones, can create moody, dramatic portraits by underexposing the image.For action or sports photography, freezing the motion is crucial. A fast shutter speed, depending on the speed of the subject, can be necessary to capture crisp, clear images without motion blur. Settings around 1/500th of a second or faster are typically recommended, depending on the intensity of the action. On the other hand, slow shutter speeds can be used creatively for long exposure photography to capture motion blur in moving subjects like waterfalls or car headlights.COMMON MISTAKES AND HOW TO AVOID THEMOne common pitfall is relying too heavily on automatic camera modes, which can limit creative control. To overcome this, photographers are encouraged to experiment with manual exposure settings, understanding how changes in aperture, shutter speed, and ISO affect their images. This hands-on practice fosters a deeper comprehension of exposure dynamics.Another frequent error is incorrect metering, which can lead to overexposed or underexposed photos. The camera's histogram provides a visual representation of the image's tonal range, helping photographers adjust settings before taking the shot. Ensuring the histogram is well-balanced without clipping the shadows or highlights is key to achieving correct exposure.Shooting in RAW format is highly recommended as it allows greater flexibility in post-processing. Unlike JPEGs, RAW files preserve all the data from the camera sensor, providing more scope to correct exposure and enhance details in the editing process. This latitude in editing is especially useful for recovering details in the blacks and highlights that may have been lost due to exposure iss",

This article teaches you to really see, anticipate moments, and bring authenticity to every shot.3 key takeaways * Be fully present: Notice patterns, light shifts, storytelling details—even in mundane scenes. * Anticipate: Study subject behaviour—people, animals, light—so you can capture fleeting moments. * Trust your vision: Frame consciously. You decide what’s meaningful—not the camera.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTIONQUICK TIPS — SHARPEN OBSERVATION * Pause first: Before photographing, spend a moment looking—what emotion or story is present? * Seek details: Notice textures, light shifts, small gestures often missed at first glance. * Explore angles: Crouch, tilt, move—new views spark fresh glimpses of meaning. * Look for rhythm: Repetition, contrast, light patterns—find or create visual balance within chaos.Photography is an art of observation. It has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them. In photography, observation takes on a deeper meaning, going beyond merely looking at subjects to truly seeing and understanding them. It involves a heightened awareness of the world around us, noticing details, patterns, and moments that others might overlook. Mastering photography observa ee them. In photography, observation takes on a deeper meaning, going beyond merely looking at subjects to truly seeing and understanding them. It involves a heightened awareness of the world around us, noticing details, patterns, and moments that others might overlook. Mastering photography observation is key to capturing captivating imagery.DEFINING OBSERVATIONAt its core, observation in photography is the act of paying attention. It requires being present in the moment and fully engaged with the environment and the subjects within it. This keen sense of observation allows photographers to capture the essence of a scene, telling a story or evoking an emotion through their images. Developing a photographic eye is essential for finding something interesting even in an ordinary place.Photography observation is not just about what is directly in front of the lens. It also encompasses the ability to anticipate and predict moments before they happen. By studying the behaviour of subjects, whether they are people, animals, or natural phenomena, photographers can position themselves to capture fleeting instances that may only occur once. Anticipation in photography is a crucial skill.THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S UNIQUE PERSPECTIVEEach photographer brings their own unique perspective in photography. Their background, experiences, and interests influence what they notice and how they choose to frame their shots. Two photographers standing side by side may see the same scene differently, resulting in vastly different images. Embracing unconventional perspectives can lead to capturing authenticity.This subjectivity is what makes photography such a powerful medium for self-expression. By honing their observational skills, photographers can develop a distinctive style that sets their work apart from others. They can use their cameras to communicate their vision of the world, sharing insights and stories that might otherwise go untold. The photographers' perspective shapes viewers' perception of the scenes they capture.CULTIVATING A KEEN EYECultivating a keen eye in photography takes practise and patience. It requires slowing down and taking the time to really look at the world around you. Instead of rushing from one shot to the next, photographers must learn to linger, exploring a scene from multiple angles and perspectives. Hyperawareness of one's surroundings is key, especially in dynamic environments.One way to cultivate observation skills is to set aside dedicated time for photography walks or outings . During these sessions, the goal is not necessarily to take photos but simply to observe and absorb the environment. By removing the pressure to capture the perfect shot, photographers can focus on developing a photographic eye and appreciating the beauty and complexity of the world. Street photography observation is an excellent way to practise this.Another approach is to challenge oneself with specific themes or subjects. For example, a photographer might spend an afternoon looking for patterns in nature or capturing candid moments of human interaction. By narrowing the focus, photographers can train their eyes to notice details they might have previously overlooked. Capturing synchronous elements, like interesting light and shadow interplay, can elevate an image.https://www.elliotterwitt.com/Elliott ErwittTHE CHALLENGES OF MODERN OBSERVATIONQUICK TIPS — CHALLENGES OF phers can train their eyes to notice details they might have previously overlooked. Capturing synchronous elements, like interesting light and shadow interplay, can elevate an image.https://www.elliotterwitt.com/Elliott ErwittTHE CHALLENGES OF MODERN OBSERVATIONQUICK TIPS — CHALLENGES OF MODERN OBSERVATIONTACKLE INFORMATION OVERLOAD * Limit digital media to avoid visual saturation. * Filter noise by focusing on key subjects and stories. * Be mindful of attention drains from constant interruptions.REDUCE DIGITAL DISTRACTIONS * Disconnect from devices during shoots. * Resist endless scrolling — stay present with your subject. * Immerse fully in the environment to see fresh details.RECLAIM YOUR ATTENTION * Slow down — observe patterns, emotions, and fleeting moments. * Practise mindfulness or meditation to stay present. * Develop empathy to capture authentic, unscripted moments.In today's fast-paced digital world, the art of observation in photography faces unique challenges. The constant barrage of information, the allure of digital distractions, and the erosion of our attention spans have a profound impact on our ability to truly see and capture meaningful moments. Photographers' challenges are compounded by the frenetic nature of modern life.INFORMATION OVERLOADOne of the primary obstacles to effective observation is information overload. In an era where we are constantly bombarded with visual stimuli from screens and devices, it becomes increasingly difficult to filter out the noise and focus on what matters. This overabundance of information can lead to a sense of visual saturation, making it harder for photographers to identify and capture the essence of a scene.Research has shown that excessive exposure to digital media can harm our cognitive abilities. A study conducted by Dr Glenn Wilson at London's Institute of Psychiatry found that persistent interruptions and distractions can cause a significant drop in IQ, comparable to the effects of sleep deprivation. This highlights the importance of being mindful of our digital consumption and its impact on our observational skills. Photographers' observation skills can be hampered by digital overload.DIGITAL DISTRACTIONSAnother challenge of being a photographer posed by modern technology is the constant temptation of digital distractions. The ubiquity of smartphones and social media apps has made it all too easy to get caught up in a cycle of scrolling, liking, and sharing rather than fully engaging with the world around us. This fragmentation of our attention can hinder our ability to be present in the moment and notice the subtle details that make for compelling photographs.As photographers, it is crucial to recognise the value of disconnecting from digital devices and immersing ourselves in the environment. By consciously limiting our reliance on technology and cultivating a more mindful approach to observation, we can rediscover the joy of seeing the world with fresh eyes. Enhancing photography observation requires being fully present.RECLAIMING OUR ATTENTIONTo overcome the challenges of modern observation, photographers must actively work to reclaim their attention. This involves developing a heightened awareness of our surroundings and taking the time to truly look at and understand the subjects we photograph. By s present.RECLAIMING OUR ATTENTIONTo overcome the challenges of modern observation, photographers must actively work to reclaim their attention. This involves developing a heightened awareness of our surroundings and taking the time to truly look at and understand the subjects we photograph. By slowing down and being more deliberate, we can train our eyes to notice patterns, emotions, and fleeting moments that might go unnoticed. The photographer's eye must be attuned to visual opportunities.Practising mindfulness and meditation can be powerful tools for enhancing photography observation. By learning to quiet the mind and focus on the present moment, photographers can cultivate a deeper connection with their subjects and create images that resonate on a profound level. Empathy in photography allows for capturing unscripted, authentic moments.TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE PHOTOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONPhotographers must cultivate a keen sense of observation to truly capture the essence of a scene. By honing their skills and adopting specific techniques, they can elevate their craft and create images that resonate on a deeper level. Mastering photography observation requires practice and dedication.CURIOSITY * Embracing curiosity is another essential aspect of enhancing photography observation. When photographers approach their subjects with a sense of wonder and openness, they are more likely to discover unique viewpoints in photography and insights. Curiosity encourages experimentation, leading to unique and creative images that push the boundaries of the medium. One way to cultivate curiosity is to set aside dedicated time for photography walks or outings. During these sessions, the goal is not necessarily to take photos but simply to observe and absorb the environment. By removing the pressure to capture the perfect shot, photographers can focus on developing their ability to see and appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world around them. Exploring the urban landscape with fresh eyes can reveal hidden gems.THE PSYCHOLOGY OF OBSERVATIONQUICK TIPS — PSYCHOLOGY OF OBSERVATIONPERCEPTION & ATTENTION * Framing scenes sharpens focus on details and emotions. * Look for subtle light shifts, textures, and patterns. * Use mindful observation to see beauty in the ordinary.COGNITIVE PROCESSES * Train memory and decision-making through practice. * Problem-solve: adapt to light, movement, and framing challenges. * Develop mental flexibility by adjusting on the spot.TRAINING THE MIND * Practise mindfulness: slow down and be present before shooting. * Stay curious — explore angles and perspectives beyond the obvious. * Use empathy and presence to capture authentic, meaningful images.The art of observation in photography has a profound impact on the psychology of the photographer. By paying close attention to the world around them, photographers engage in a process that influences their perception, attention, and cognitive processes. Photographers' observation skills are deeply tied to their psychological state.PERCEPTION AND ATTENTIONThe act of observing through a lens has the power to alter how photographers perceive their surroundings. As they search for compelling subjects and compositions, they become more attuned to the subtle details, patterns, and emotions present in the scene. This heightened awareness can lead to a shift in attention, with photographers focusing more intently on the elements that contrib their surroundings. As they search for compelling subjects and compositions, they become more attuned to the subtle details, patterns, and emotions present in the scene. This heightened awareness can lead to a shift in attention, with photographers focusing more intently on the elements that contribute to a strong image. Capturing the moment in photography requires keen perception and attention.Research has shown that the mere act of framing a scene through a viewfinder can influence perception. A study conducted by Dr Tiffany Luong at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that participants who viewed images through a camera frame perceived them as more aesthetically pleasing compared to those who viewed the same scenes without a frame. This suggests that the process of observation in photography can enhance the perceived beauty and significance of a subject. The photographer's eye is attuned to visual appeal.COGNITIVE PROCESSES IN PHOTOGRAPHYObservation in photography also engages various cognitive processes, such as memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. As photographers observe a scene, they must quickly assess the available light, the arrangement of elements, and the potential for capturing a meaningful moment. This requires a combination of technical knowledge and creative intuition, both of which are honed through practise and experience. Photography fundamentals involve cognitive skills.The act of creating a photograph also involves a form of problem-solving, as photographers must navigate challenges of being a photographer such as changing light conditions, moving subjects, and compositional obstacles. By constantly observing and adapting to their environment, photographers develop a mental flexibility that allows them to find creative solutions in the moment. Improving photography skills requires cognitive agility.TRAINING THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S MINDCultivating a keen eye in photography is essential for photographers who wish to create impactful images. This skill can be developed through a combination of mindfulness, curiosity, and practice. By approaching each scene with an open mind and a willingness to explore, photographers can train their eyes to notice the extraordinary in the ordinary. Developing a photographic eye is a mental discipline.One effective way to enhance observation skills is by focusing on the present moment and paying attention to the sensations, emotions, and thoughts that arise, photographers can develop a greater awareness of their surroundings. This heightened awareness can translate into more meaningful and authentic images that capture the essence of a scene. Empathy and presence are key to mindful photography.FROM OBSERVATION TO ARTISTIC EXPRESSIONQUICK TIPS — FROM OBSERVATION TO ARTISTIC EXPRESSIONTRANSLATE VISION * Master composition, light, and perspective to express ideas. * Experiment with angles and abstract elements to refine voice. * Use trial and error to strengthen your visual language.DEVELOP STYLE * Focus on subjects and themes that genuinely resonate with you. * Build cohesion by revisiting these themes consistently. * Experiment with post-processing to refine your aesthetic.TRUST INTUITION * Be present and open to spontaneous moments. * Follow gut feelings on framing, timing, and lighting choices. * Practise often to strengthen instinctive decision-making.The journey from keen observation to artistic expression in photography invo",

Let simplicity carry the story.INTRODUCTIONQUICK TIPS — INTRODUCTION * Simplify the frame—let clean lines, shapes and space carry the story. * Decide the one essential element; remove everything else. * Use negative space intentionally to create calm and focus.In visual arts, minimalist photography stands out as a powerful approach to capturing simplicity and essence. This artistic style, favoured by many renowned minimalist photographers, emphasises the beauty of clean lines, negative space, and geometric shapes, inviting viewers to focus on the core elements of an image. By stripping away extraneous details, photographers can create visually striking compositions that tell compelling stories with minimal elements, whether they are capturing minimalist architecture photography, still life, or landscapes.This article delves into the fundamental concepts of “What is minimalist photography” for beginners. It explores the essential elements that define this style, including composition techniques, complementary colours, and the importance of scale. Readers will discover how to harness negative space, a crucial space photography element, employ leading lines (visual pathways), and create a strong focal point to achieve maximum visual impact. By mastering these principles, aspiring photographers can develop their skills to create stunning minimalist images that resonate with viewers and embody the minimalist aesthetic, whether they are interested in minimalist, landscape photography, product photography, food photography, or portrait minimalism.DEFINING WHAT IS MINIMALISM IN PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — WHAT IS MINIMALIST PHOTOGRAPHY? * Focus on the bare essentials: subject, light, composition. * Limit the palette; prefer complementary or monochrome colour. * Use geometric shapes and clean lines to structure the frame.Minimalist photography is a style that emphasises simplicity and focuses on the bare essential elements in a composition. This approach aims to capture impactful stories with minimal elements, creating clean and uncluttered images that convey a sense of calmness, peacefulness, and order. By stripping away extraneous details, photographers can create visually striking compositions that tell compelling stories with minimal elements, showcasing the power of simplicity photography.KEY CHARACTERISTICSThe key characteristics of minimalist photography include: 1. Limited colours: A restricted colour palette is used to create a cohesive and simple visual experience. This often involves using complementary colours or bold colours to create visual impact. 2. Shapes and lines: Incorporating geometric shapes and clean lines to add structure and visual interest. Understanding the definition of line photography is crucial for creating compelling minimalist compositions. 3. Textures: Utilising subtle textures to add depth without overwhelming the composition. This is particularly important in minimalist architecture photography, where the interplay of light and shadow on architectural details can create striking visual effects. 4. Negative space: Employing ample empty areas to create balance and draw attention to the subject. Negative space is a key space photography ele y important in minimalist architecture photography, where the interplay of light and shadow on architectural details can create striking visual effects. 4. Negative space: Employing ample empty areas to create balance and draw attention to the subject. Negative space is a key space photography element that can be used to create a sense of scale and isolation.View fullsizeIMPORTANCE OF SIMPLICITYSimplicity is the cornerstone of minimalist photography. It involves capturing the essence of the subject by removing all distractions and unnecessary details, embracing the concept of simple photography. This approach has an influence on how photographers compose their shots: 1. Focus on the essential: By eliminating clutter and excessive detail, photographers can highlight the most important elements of their subject, whether it's a piece of minimalist architecture, a simple still life, or a striking portrait. 2. Create balance: Simplicity helps to achieve a harmonious composition, where each element has a purpose and contributes to the overall visual impact. This is where understanding the composition photography definition and the definition of composition in photography becomes crucial. 3. Enhance visual storytelling : With fewer elements to distract the viewer, the photographer can more effectively convey their intended message or emotion. Minimalist images can serve as powerful story inspiration pictures or inspiration images that spark the viewer's imagination.ROLE OF NEGATIVE SPACEQUICK TIPS — NEGATIVE SPACE * Isolate the subject with clear, open areas to guide attention. * Balance: let space counterweight the subject’s visual mass. * Scale & mood: small subject + vast space = calm, contemplative feel.Negative space plays a crucial role in minimalist photography. It refers to the area around the subject that contains little to no detail. Understanding how to use negative space effectively can be a powerful tool for creating eye-catching and memorable photographs. Here's how negative space contributes to minimalist compositions: 1. Isolation of the subject: By surrounding the main element with ample negative space, the viewer's attention is drawn directly to the focal point, whether it's a piece of minimalist architecture, a simple product in product photography, or a beautifully plated dish in food photography. 2. Creation of balance: Negative space is just as important as the subject itself, helping to create a sense of equilibrium in the composition. 3. Emphasis on scale: The use of negative space can create a sense of scale in minimalist photography. For example, a small subject placed in a large space can appear even smaller, emphasising its size in relation to its environment. 4. Evocation of mood: The abundance of negative space can evoke a calming, meditative mood in the viewer, enhancing the overall impact of the image.By mastering the use of negative space, photographers can create minimalist images that are visually striking and emotionally resonant. This technique, combined with a focus on simplicity and essential elements, forms the foundation of the minimalist photography style.ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF MINIMALIST PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — SUBJECT ISOLATION * Tighten framing to remove distractions; keep edges clean. * Use negative space and shallow depth of field when helpful. * Play with scale—small subject in large space adds emphasis.M minimalist photography style.ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF MINIMALIST PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — SUBJECT ISOLATION * Tighten framing to remove distractions; keep edges clean. * Use negative space and shallow depth of field when helpful. * Play with scale—small subject in large space adds emphasis.Minimalist photography is distinguished by its emphasis on simplicity and focus on the essential elements of an image. By stripping away unnecessary details, photographers can create visually striking compositions that tell compelling stories with minimal elements. To achieve this aesthetic, photographers must master several key concepts and techniques.SUBJECT ISOLATIONSubject isolation is crucial in minimalist photography. It involves focusing the viewer's eye on a singular object or subject while eliminating distractions. This can be achieved through various methods: 1. Careful framing: Compose the shot to remove any extraneous elements, ensuring that only the essential components remain in the frame. This is particularly important in minimalist architecture photography, where the focus is on highlighting the clean lines and geometric shapes of the structure. 2. Use of negative space: Incorporate ample empty areas around the subject to create balance and draw attention to the main element. Negative space is a key space photography element that can be used to create a sense of scale and isolation. 3. Depth of field : Employ a shallow depth of field to blur the background, keeping the subject in sharp focus and minimising distractions. This technique is often used in product photography and food photography to draw attention to the main subject. 4. Scale: Create a sense of scale by placing a small subject within a large, empty space, emphasising its size in relation to its environment. This can be particularly effective in portrait minimalism, where the subject is isolated against a simple background.View fullsizeCOMPOSITION TECHNIQUESQUICK TIPS — COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES * Use thirds or centred symmetry—choose calmly, not by habit. * Lead the eye with simple lines; repeat shapes for rhythm. * Add breathing room—let negative space do part of the composing.Effective composition is vital in minimalist photography. Understanding the composition photography definition and the definition of composition in photography is essential for creating compelling minimalist images. Key techniques include: 1. Rule of thirds : Divide the frame into a grid of three horizontal and three vertical lines, placing the subject at the intersections for a balanced composition. 2. Leading lines : Incorporate simple lines and geometric shapes to guide the viewer's eye and create a sense of movement within the image. Understanding the line photography definition is crucial for creating compelling minimalist compositions. 3. Symmetry and patterns : Utilise symmetrical compositions or repeating patterns to create visually appealing minimalist images. This can be particularly effective in minimalist architecture photography, where the repetition of architectural details can create striking visual effects. 4. Negative space: Employ negative space strategically to create a sense of calmness, balance, and breathing room within the composition.USE OF COLOUR AND CONTRASTQUICK TIP minimalist architecture photography, where the repetition of architectural details can create striking visual effects. 4. Negative space: Employ negative space strategically to create a sense of calmness, balance, and breathing room within the composition.USE OF COLOUR AND CONTRASTQUICK TIPS — COLOUR & CONTRAST * Keep colours minimal; consider monochrome for pure form. * Use a single bold accent only if it serves the idea. * Control tonal contrast so the subject stands cleanly apart.Colour and contrast play significant roles in minimalist photography: 1. Limited colour palette: Use a restricted colour palette to create a cohesive and simple visual experience. This can involve monochromatic colour schemes or complementary colours. 2. Black and white: Converting images to black and white can eliminate distractions caused by jarring colours and emphasise form and composition. 3. Bold colours: When using colour, ensure it serves a purpose and adds meaning to the image without overwhelming the subject. Bold colours can be used sparingly to create visual impact and draw the viewer's attention. 4. Contrast: Utilise contrast effectively to make the subject stand out. This can be achieved through differences in colour, tone, or texture between the subject and its surroundings.By mastering these essential elements, photographers can create powerful minimalist images that resonate with viewers and embody the minimalist aesthetic. The key lies in simplifying the composition, isolating the subject, and using colour and contrast purposefully to create visually striking and emotionally evocative photographs.Capturing Minimalist ImagesTo create captivating minimalist photographs, photographers need to consider several key aspects, including equipment selection, camera settings, and location choices. By mastering these elements, one can produce visually striking compositions that embody the minimalist aesthetic, whether they are interested in minimalist architecture photography, product photography, food photography, or portrait minimalism.MINIMAL PHOTOGRAPHY EXAMPLESCoincidently whilst planning this article I was asked to judge a PhotoCrowd Competition on Minimalist Landscapes. With almost 5,000 entries it was a interesting to see just how people interpret minimalist photos for submission.I had to pause and think about what was my criteria for judging minimalist landscape photography before starting the judging process. I came up with a broad list of bullets that I personally felt would best fit my definition of a minimalist photo.MY PERSONAL CRITERIA FOR WHAT IS MINIMALIST PHOTOGRAPHY IS?QUICK TIPS — MY MINIMALISM CRITERIA * Minimal colour palette (or complementary pairs). * Minimal texture changes; avoid busy detail. * Small subject scale; clear focal point. * 70–90% negative space where possible. * Clean lines, repeating shapes; simple directional design. * Strong single subject/focus; simplicity first. * Story: space + subject must say something together. 1. MINIMAL COLOUR PALETTE OR COMPLEMENTARY COLOURS 2. MINIMAL TEXTURE CHANGES SO AS NOT TO DISTRACT THE EYE 3. MINIMUM SCALE OF SUBJECT - MAKE IS SMALL IN THE COMPOSITION AND FRAMING 4. MAXIMUM SPACE AROUND THE SUBJECT (NEGATIVE SPACE) - SAY 70%-90% SPACE AND ENVIRONMENT 5. THE USE OF LINES AND SHAPES, DIRECTIONAL LINES, REPEATING PATTERNS OR ELEMENTS 6. STRONG FOCAL POINT AND SIMPLICITY IN THE MINIMALIST PICTURES 7. STORYTELLI",

Let subject’s personality guide your style.From type and intent to light, composition, and editing, this roadmap helps you create portraits that feel authentic, personal, and recognisably yours.DIFFERENT TYPES OF PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — EXPLORE PORTRAIT TYPES * Environmental: Place subjects in context of work/lifestyle. * Candid: Capture natural, unposed expressions and gestures. * Studio: Control every aspect of light and background. * Creative: Use styling, props, or abstract framing for impact.PORTRAIT STYLESSTYLES OF PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY — AT A GLANCE * Lifestyle: Natural, candid settings that tell the subject’s everyday story. * Traditional: Classic head-and-shoulder poses, studio light, clean backdrops. * Headshots: Professional close-ups for profiles, actors, or corporate use. * Environmental: Subject in a meaningful location (home, studio, workplace). * Street & Candid: Unposed, authentic emotions in public spaces. * Fine Art: Creative, conceptual, inspired by other art forms. * Self-Portraits: Personal, introspective exploration of identity. * Glamour & Boudoir: Intimate, styled, and confidence-focused imagery.Portrait photography spans from classic studio headshots to candid street captures and conceptual fine art. Each style highlights the subject’s character in a unique way.Portrait photography encompasses various portrait styles, each capturing the subject’s essence in unique ways. Let's explore three primary types of portraiture: traditional portraits, environmental portraits, and candid and lifestyle portraits.LIFESTYLE PORTRAITSLifestyle portraits are a popular and dynamic style of photography that aims to capture individuals or groups in natural, authentic settings that reflect their everyday lives, personalities, and interests. Unlike traditional studio portraits, lifestyle photography focuses on creating candid, relaxed images that tell a story about the subject(s) and their environment.TRADITIONAL PORTRAITSTraditional portraiture is the classic approach that often comes to mind when thinking of portrait photography. These images typic studio portraits, lifestyle photography focuses on creating candid, relaxed images that tell a story about the subject(s) and their environment.TRADITIONAL PORTRAITSTraditional portraiture is the classic approach that often comes to mind when thinking of portrait photography. These images typically focus on the subject's head and shoulders, emphasising facial features and expressions. Photographers usually employ a solid-coloured backdrop and studio lighting to create a clean, professional look. The subject often looks directly into the camera, presenting a timeless and universally flattering image. This style adheres to basic composition rules, such as the rule of thirds, and relies on the strategic use of lighting, angles, and posing to achieve a polished result.HEADSHOT PORTRAITSHeadshot portraits are a specific type of traditional portrait photography that focuses on capturing the subject's head and shoulders. These images are commonly used for professional purposes, such as actor headshots, corporate profiles, or social media profiles. The goal of headshot portraits is to present the subject in a flattering and approachable manner, showcasing their personality and professionalism. Photographers often use controlled lighting setups and minimalistic backgrounds to create a clean and polished look. By mastering the art of close-up portrait photography, photographers can provide clients with impactful images that leave a lasting impression.ENVIRONMENTAL PORTRAITSEnvironmental portraits offer a compelling blend of subject and surroundings. These images showcase individuals in settings that hold significance to them, such as their workplace, home, or favourite locations. The environment plays a crucial role in conveying information about the subject's personality, profession, or lifestyle. Unlike traditional portraits, environmental shots often utilise a wider depth of field to capture background details that provide context. This style allows for a deeper exploration of the subject's character, whether it's a chef in their kitchen or an artist in their studio. The key lies in the symbolism expressed by various elements in the background, which contribute to telling the subject's story.STREET AND CANDID PORTRAITSStreet and Candid Portraits are a style of photography that focuses on capturing authentic moments and genuine emotions in everyday life. These portraits often take place in public spaces, such as streets, parks, or markets, where subjects are unaware of the camera. The goal is to document real-life interactions and capture the essence of people in their natural environment. Street portraits require a keen eye for composition and the ability to anticipate and capture fleeting moments that tell a story.FINE ART PORTRAITSFine Art Portraits are another style of portrait photography that offers a unique and artistic approach. These portraits often involve creative concepts, unconventional poses, and experimental techniques to evoke emotion and provoke thought. Fine art portraits go beyond capturing a person's physical appearance and aim to convey a deeper meaning or message. Photographers in this genre often draw inspiration from various art forms, such as painting or sculpture, to create visually captivating and thought-provoking images. The key to successful fine art portraits lies in the ability to blend technical skill with artistic vision, resulting in truly captivating and impactful photographs.SELF- nspiration from various art forms, such as painting or sculpture, to create visually captivating and thought-provoking images. The key to successful fine art portraits lies in the ability to blend technical skill with artistic vision, resulting in truly captivating and impactful photographs.SELF-PORTRAITSSelf-Portraits are a form of portrait photography where the photographer becomes the subject. By turning the camera on themselves, photographers have the opportunity to explore their own identity, emotions, and experiences. Self-portraits can be a deeply personal and introspective form of expression, allowing photographers to convey their unique perspective and tell their own stories through the lens. The process of creating self-portraits also offers a chance for self-reflection and self-discovery, as photographers navigate the balance between vulnerability and self-representation.GLAMOUR AND BOUDOIR PORTRAITSGlamour and Boudoir Portraits offer a more intimate and sensual approach to portrait photography. These images focus on capturing the subject's beauty, confidence, and allure. Glamour portraits often involve professional hair and makeup styling, as well as carefully selected wardrobe styling. Boudoir portraits, on the other hand, aim to create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability by photographing subjects in lingerie or tastefully nude. Both styles require a skilled photographer who can create a comfortable and empowering environment for the subject, resulting in stunning and empowering images.View fullsizeCOMPOSITION RULES FOR IMPACTFUL PORTRAITSQUICK TIPS — COMPOSE EFFECTIVELY * Follow the rule of thirds but break it to emphasise eye contact. * Leave breathing space in direction of gaze for balance. * Use leading lines, frames, or props to draw focus to the face. * Check edges for clutter — simplify background distractions.Composition serves as the backbone of good photography, playing a crucial role in creating visually appealing and impactful portraits. Every element within the frame contributes to the overall balance of the image. When presented with a well-composed portrait alongside a poorly composed one, most viewers can easily identify the superior image. To create compelling portraits, photographers can employ several key composition techniques.RULE OF THIRDSThe rule of thirds is a fundamental principle that many photographers use as a starting point for creating well-balanced images. This technique involves dividing the frame into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. The photographer then positions the main subject or key elements of the portrait along these lines or at their intersections.For portrait photography, this rule can be applied in several ways: 1. Positioning the subject's eyes: Place the subject's eyes along the upper horizontal line or at one of the upper intersection points. 2. Framing the face: Position the subject's face in one of the side thirds of the image, leaving space in the direction they are looking. 3. Horizon placement: When including a background, place the horizon along the top or bottom third of the image rather than in the centre.By following this rule, photographers can create more dynamic and visually exciting portraits that naturally draw the viewer's eye to the subject.LEADING LINESLeading lines are powerful compositiona om third of the image rather than in the centre.By following this rule, photographers can create more dynamic and visually exciting portraits that naturally draw the viewer's eye to the subject.LEADING LINESLeading lines are powerful compositional tools that guide the viewer's eye through the photograph towards the main subject. In portrait photography, these lines can be used to create depth and direct attention to the subject's face or other important features.Some examples of leading lines in portrait photography include: 1. Architectural elements: Use doorways, staircases, or building edges to frame the subject and lead the eye. 2. Natural elements: Incorporate tree branches, paths, or shorelines to create lines that point towards the subject. 3. Props or clothing: Utilise the subject's clothing, accessories, or props to create lines that draw attention to their face or expression.FRAMING TECHNIQUESFraming is a composition technique that involves using elements within the scene to create a frame around the subject. This method helps to isolate the subject and draw the viewer's attention to the main focal point of the portrait.Effective framing techniques for portrait photography include: 1. Natural frames: Use tree branches, archways, or windows to surround the subject. 2. Environmental elements: Incorporate doorways, mirrors, or other architectural features to frame the subject within their surroundings. 3. Foreground elements: Position objects in the foreground to create a partial frame, adding depth to the image.By employing these composition rules, photographers can create visually striking and emotionally engaging portraits that capture the essence of their subjects.CAMERA SETTINGS FOR PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — CAMERA SETUP * Use wide apertures (f/1.8–f/4) for shallow depth and subject isolation. * Keep shutter >1/125s to freeze subtle movements. * Choose focal lengths 50–135mm to flatter proportions and avoid distortion. * Shoot RAW for post flexibility with skin tones and light.When it comes to camera settings for portrait photography, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind. Firstly, using a wide aperture (low f-stop number) can help create a shallow depth of field, resulting in a beautifully blurred background that emphasises the subject. Secondly, adjusting the ISO and shutter speed to the appropriate level for the lighting conditions can help maintain image quality and reduce noise. Lastly, experimenting with different white balance settings can add a creative touch to your portraits, allowing you to play with warm or cool tones to evoke different moods. By mastering these camera settings, photographers can capture stunning portraits that truly stand out.LIGHTING FOR PORTRAITSQUICK TIPS — WORK WITH LIGHT * Soft, diffused light flatters skin — use windows or softboxes. * Golden hour outdoors for warmth; open shade for even tones. * Rembrandt and butterfly lighting create shape and mood in faces. * Watch catchlights in the eyes — they bring portraits to life.Lighting is a crucial aspect of portrait photography that can greatly enhance the overall quality of an image.

Also, the piece looks at ways to beat fear, use photos to tell stories, and adjust to different cultures, giving a full guide for those who want to do well in this changing field.STREET PHOTOGRAPHY — ROADMAP * Confidence & ethics: Blend in, be respectful, know your public-space rights; avoid vulnerable subjects. * Capture spontaneity: Zone focus, pre-set exposure, carry camera ready; anticipate gestures and movement. * Place & culture: Use backgrounds, signage and architecture to add context; show relationships to place. * Story first: Think in mini-series; use light, timing, and juxtaposition to build narrative. * Field craft: Work a corner, use layers/reflections, hunt for shafts of light and silhouettes. * Post: Cull for gesture; keep tones believable; sequence images for flow and cohesion.Read a scene fast, respect people and places, and let timing + light do the storytelling.GETTING OVER FEAR AND WORRY IN STREET PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — BUILDING CONFIDENCE * Begin with small, discreet cameras in quieter locations to ease into shooting. * Dress to blend in, adopt a friendly demeanour, and practice approaching locals. * Stay calm if confronted—explain your intent or offer to delete the image. * Know your rights: in the UK, public shooting is allowed—respect privacy boundaries.Street photography can scare you, but it's important to remember it takes courage. Photographers can gain confidence by starting in quieter areas and using smaller less noticeable cameras. Looking at famous street photographers' work and shooting often helps improve skills and ease.GAINING CONFIDENCETo increase self-assurance, photographers should dress in a way that helps them fit in and keep a friendly attitude. Getting in touch with other street photographers can give useful insights and backing. Beginning with 'street portraits' by seeking permission can help photographers ease into the practice.DEALING WITH CONFRONTATIONWhen someone challenges you, it's key to stay calm and polite. Telling them why you're taking photos on the street and giving a compliment can often calm tense moments. If a person demands you delete a photo, it's best to do it to avoid making things worse.LEGAL RIGHTSIn the UK, photographers have the freedom to take pictures in public spaces without asking for permission. However, they should keep in mind where private property starts and ends, and make sure not to bother anyone. Knowing these rights can make photographers feel more at ease when taking shots in public. UK Photographers Rights ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN STREET PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — ETHICS & CULTURAL SENSITIVITY * Respect privacy: avoid photographing vulnerable subjects, especially children. * Use permission when needed, particularly in cultures that value privacy. * Research local customs—some communities or religious sites may restrict photography.RESPECTING PRIVACYStreet photographers must create their own set of guidelines to handle ethical issues. This involves respecting people's privacy in public spaces. Photographers should avoid taking pictures of individuals in vulnerable situations or those struggling with life's challenges.

Photographers should avoid taking pictures of individuals in vulnerable situations or those struggling with life's challenges. It's essential to be careful when photographing children, as this needs extra care. Some photographers ask for permission, either by speaking or through gestures like a nod or raising the camera.ASKING FOR PERMISSIONPeople still argue about whether street photographers should ask before taking pictures. Getting permission can help new photographers feel more comfortable, but it might make candid street photography shots less real. When people know they're being photographed, they often put on an act. But in some places, you have to ask. For example, in parts of Africa and in Old Order Amish Mennonite communities, taking photos without asking is seen as disrespectful.BEING AWARE OF CULTURAL SENSITIVITIESCultural awareness plays a key role in street photography. Photographers need to show respect for local customs and religious beliefs. Take Buddhist temples in many Asian countries as an example. They don't allow photography inside to keep the peace during services. In the same way, some cultures hold specific views about images. The Amish, for instance, think photographs can lead to pride or sin. People who travel should look into and grasp these cultural differences before they take pictures in new places.STREET PHOTOGRAPHY ACROSS DIFFERENT CULTURESQUICK TIPS — CAPTURING SPONTANEITY * Use zone focusing for quick response—set focus and aperture beforehand. * Choose compact cameras or smartphones to stay unnoticed and more agile. * Dress to fit in and carry your camera ready to shoot—moments vanish fast.ADAPTING TO LOCAL CUSTOMSStreet photographers must adjust their approach based on cultural norms. In London, people value privacy and personal space, making discreet shooting necessary. Conversely, in Mumbai, the bustling streets allow for more open photography. Researching local customs before travelling helps photographers avoid unintentionally causing offence.OVERCOMING LANGUAGE BARRIERSWhen verbal communication is challenging, photographers can use gestures to indicate their intent to take photos. Offering business cards or taking email addresses to share images can build trust. Engaging with subjects, even through non-verbal means, can lead to more authentic and powerful portraits.RESPECTING RELIGIOUS PRACTISESReligious sites and practices require special consideration. Photographers should be aware of restrictions on photography in places of worship, such as Buddhist temples in Asia. When documenting religious events or individuals, it's crucial to approach the subject with sensitivity and respect, avoiding exploitation or misrepresentation of sacred traditions.METHODS TO CAPTURE SPONTANEOUS MOMENTSQUICK TIPS — CAPTURING SPONTANEITY * Use zone focusing for quick response—set focus and aperture beforehand. * Choose compact cameras or smartphones to stay unnoticed and more agile. * Dress to fit in and carry your camera ready to shoot—moments vanish fast.Taking spontaneous street photos needs skill and care.

This method lets photographers snap fleeting moments without fiddling with camera settings.USING A SMALL CAMERACompact cameras or smartphones, like mirrorless cameras, don't scare people as much as big DSLRs, making it easier to blend in and snap candid moments. Their subtle nature allows photographers to move in busy streets.BEING DISCREETBeing discreet plays a vital role in street photography. Photographers should wear clothes that help them blend with their urban environment and not attract attention. By watching and predicting moments, they can snap genuine scenes without interfering with the natural rhythm of life in public areas.CAPTURING THE ESSENCE OF A PLACE THROUGH STREET PHOTOSQUICK TIPS — CAPTURING PLACE & CULTURE * Show local culture through interactions, architecture, and community rituals. * Seek authentic scenes: people's relationships with their environment tell the story. * Use backgrounds purposefully—structures and patterns add depth and context.Street photography can reveal a city's heart and share its stories. To show what makes a place special, photographers should pay attention to three main things: local culture, how people interact, and unique buildings.DOCUMENTING LOCAL CULTURETo snap real moments, photographers need to dive into the local community. Photographers can find special photo chances by talking with locals and hearing their stories. It's key to honour local ways and customs, steering clear of cultural theft.FOCUSING ON HUMAN INTERACTIONSPeople's actions and how they connect make up the core of society. Street photographers should look for times when people work together or compete, which often happens in a flash. Going to local events can boost the odds of catching these moments, as folks tend to mingle more during fun activities.HIGHLIGHTING UNIQUE ARCHITECTUREThe physical environment has a significant impact on a place's identity. Photographers should focus on the lines, shapes, and structures that local infrastructure creates. Mixing building elements with people in photos can make strong images that show how folks connect with their surroundings.STORYTELLING THROUGH STREET PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — TELL A STORY * Build mini photo essays around themes to give purpose and coherence. * Develop your style—choose gear and methods that match your vision. * Capture emotion and connections—gestures, glances, and interactions are key.CREATING PHOTO ESSAYSPhoto essays have an influence on viewers allowing them to explore a topic or idea through a set of images. These visual stories can focus on broad themes, like city street photography in a certain time period, or follow a specific storyline. Photographers start by choosing a theme or idea they want to share then tackle the subject in a planned or documentary-like way. They aim to put together a group of photos that draw viewers into the subject, with each picture adding to the overall story.TO DEVELOP A CONSISTENT STYLETo develop a distinctive street photography style, photographers should try out different equipment and subjects. Getting ideas from both old-school and modern photographers, like James Maher w viewers into the subject, with each picture adding to the overall story.TO DEVELOP A CONSISTENT STYLETo develop a distinctive street photography style, photographers should try out different equipment and subjects. Getting ideas from both old-school and modern photographers, like James Maher photography , helps expand one's outlook. Sticking to projects using certain gear and methods, helps to build a unified vision. Adding personal feelings and views gives the work a unique flavour. Shooting often in well-known areas helps create a deeper more personal style. Editing is key to shaping the photographer's vision and polishing their style.CAPTURING EMOTIONSStreet photography shines when it captures raw emotions and real moments. Photographers need sharp eyes to spot telling gestures and looks that reveal what's going on in people's heads. You'll often see impatience, boredom, frustration, and amusement in street photos. When anger, despair, or joy show up , they can make for strong images if the shot is well-composed and sound. It's key for photographers to care about their subjects. This helps them tell stories with respect and truth showing the cultural and social setting they're capturing.COMBINING STREET AND TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — STREET MEETS TRAVEL * Explore beyond landmarks—wander side streets and local markets for authentic moments. * Document travel as a visual story—capture rituals, scenes, and interactions beyond the obvious. * Avoid clichés—look for fresh perspectives on everyday scenes to elevate your imagery.Street photography and travel photography intertwine seamlessly, offering a unique perspective on destinations. Photographers can capture the essence of a place by exploring beyond famous landmarks. Wandering side streets and local markets often leads to authentic moments and engaging photos. To document a journey effectively, one should approach it as a visual storyteller, combining exploration with technical skills.DOCUMENTING YOUR JOURNEYPhotographers should treat their travels as a narrative, capturing moments that reflect personal experiences. This approach allows for a more intimate portrayal of destinations, going beyond typical tourist snapshots. By focusing on unique details and interactions, photographers can create a compelling visual diary of their adventures.CAPTURING LOCAL LIFETo truly represent a location, photographers should immerse themselves in local culture. This involves interacting with residents, understanding their experiences, and respecting local customs. Festivals and celebrations offer excellent opportunities to capture people in relaxed, joyful settings. These events often provide colourful scenes and willing subjects for portraits.AVOIDING CLICHÉSTo create innovative travel photography, it's crucial to move beyond postcard-like images. Photographers should strive to show destinations in fresh, thought-provoking ways. This might involve focusing on small, recurring details or exploring the relationship between tourists and residents. By staying true to their unique style and perspective, photographers can produce distinctive images that stand out from typical travel photography.CONCLUSION - STREET PHOTOGRAPHY TIPSStreet photography has a profound influence on how travellers capture and share their experiences.

This lesson explains what focus is (and isn’t), how autofocus modes/areas work, and the simple habits that raise your sharp-hit rate fast. * Mode vs area: AF-S/One-Shot for static; AF-C/AI-Servo for movement. Choose an area that matches your subject size (single point, expanded, zone, wide/auto with eye detection). * Aim the right point: eyes for people, closest eye if angled; leading edge for wildlife/sport; avoid focus-recompose at shallow depth of field. * Technique matters: half-press or back-button focus, burst wisely, and stabilise. Depth of field, subject distance and focal length all affect what looks “in focus”.3 key takeaways 1. Match AF to motion: use continuous AF and an area that covers the subject when anything moves. 2. Prioritise the eye/leading edge: place the active point on the critical detail; don’t rely on recompose at wide apertures. 3. Control the variables: keep shutter high enough for your focal length, stop down when you need more depth, and practice BBF for consistent timing.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS FOCUS IN PHOTOGRAPHYIn the nuanced world of photography, the question of what is focus photography transcends the mere act of h, stop down when you need more depth, and practice BBF for consistent timing.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS FOCUS IN PHOTOGRAPHYIn the nuanced world of photography, the question of what is focus photography transcends the mere act of making subjects look sharp; it is central to the art and science of capturing images that evoke emotion, tell stories, and preserve moments. Mastery of focus—a blend of sharpness, depth of field, and the interplay of focus point photography—empowers photographers to direct viewers' attention effectively within a frame. The ability to manipulate focus photos through autofocus systems, controlling the focal plane, or employing techniques like focus stacking and hyperfocal distance is vital for achieving visual clarity and depth. This critical element determines not just the subjects' clarity but also the photograph's overall impact, making understanding photo focus essential for anyone looking to elevate their photographic work.This article will explore the foundational aspects of focusing in photography, including the significance of focus points, the mechanics of camera focus, and how depth of field contributes to the perception of sharpness. It will delve into autofocus modes, from phase detection autofocus to AF-S, and the practical utilities of focus peaking and focus stacking. Additionally, readers will learn about techniques for achieving perfect focus pictures, overcoming common focusing challenges like \"why won't my camera focus\", and the role of the focus ring, among other focus techniques. By demystifying these concepts, the article aims to arm aspiring object photographers with the knowledge to harness focusing to its full potential, transforming their approach to photography through precision, creativity, and control.THE SCIENCE BEHIND CAMERA FOCUSING: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWTHE BASICS OF CAMERA FOCUSINGAt its core, camera focusing is the process of adjusting the lens to achieve optimal sharpness and clarity for the desired subject or area within the scene. This is accomplished by converging the light rays from the subject onto the camera's image sensor or film plane, resulting in a precisely focused image.WHAT IS CAMERA FOCUSING?Camera focusing is the act of finding the optimal sharpness of an object within the frame. A completely sharp image is said to be in focus, while a blurry or indistinct image is considered out of focus. The focusing mechanism works by adjusting the distance between the lens and the image sensor or film, allowing light to converge precisely at the desired plane.TYPES OF CAMERA-FOCUSING SYSTEMSThere are several types of focusing systems employed in cameras: 1. Split-Image Rangefinder: This system displays two images of the subject, which align and merge when the subject is in focus. 2. Matte Field: A matte surface within the viewfinder aids in quick shooting and low-light situations. 3. Microprism Ring: This system consists of numerous tiny prisms and is useful for focusing on subjects lacking distinct vertical elements. 4. Phase Detection Autofocus: Found in modern DSLR cameras, this system uses a dedicated autofocus sensor to detect and achieve focus by analysing the phase differences between light rays. 5. Contrast Detection Autofocus: Common in mirrorless cameras and live view modes, this system analyses the image’s contrast on the primary sensor to determine and adjust focu ystem uses a dedicated autofocus sensor to detect and achieve focus by analysing the phase differences between light rays. 5. Contrast Detection Autofocus: Common in mirrorless cameras and live view modes, this system analyses the image’s contrast on the primary sensor to determine and adjust focus.----------------------------------------HOW AUTOFOCUS WORKS IN MODERN CAMERASTHE SCIENCE BEHIND CAMERA FOCUSING — QUICK REFERENCEFocusing moves lens elements so light converges on the sensor at the chosen plane of focus. Below are the main focusing systems and how modern autofocus (AF) methods differ.System / Aid How it works Strengths Limitations Best use Split-image rangefinder (manual aid) Two half-images align when focus is correct. Very precise on defined edges/lines. Struggles in low light/low contrast; slows shooting. Manual focus lenses; static subjects. Matte field (manual aid) Ground-glass texture shows peak sharpness. Good general manual focusing feedback. Harder at very wide apertures or dim scenes. Manual focusing, tripod work. Microprism ring (manual aid) Tiny prisms shimmer when out of focus. Quick visual cue for rough focus. Less precise; can sparkle in low contrast. Fast manual focus on mid-contrast subjects. Phase-detection AF Splits light into pairs; measures phase difference to know direction & amount to drive focus. Very fast acquisition; excellent subject tracking. Can misfocus in very low light or low contrast; requires calibration on some DSLR bodies. Sport, wildlife, people in motion. (DSLR: dedicated AF module; mirrorless: on-sensor PDAF.) Contrast-detection AF Analyzes image contrast on the main sensor; peaks at max contrast = sharpest focus. Very precise for static subjects; no AF calibration needed. Slower “hunt”; weaker for moving subjects. Tripod, product, macro, landscapes; live view. Hybrid AF Combines PDAF speed with contrast AF fine-tune (often on-sensor). Fast and accurate; best all-round performance. Can still slow in very dim/low-contrast scenes. Modern mirrorless for most subjects; eye/face/animal AF.AUTOFOCUS METHODS — AT A GLANCEAF method Speed Precision (static) Tracking (moving) Low light / low contrast Notes / best practice Phase-detect ★★★★★ ★★★★☆ ★★★★★ ★★★☆☆ Use AF-C/servo with subject-appropriate area; micro-adjust (DSLR) if needed. Contrast-detect ★★★☆☆ ★★★★★ ★★☆☆☆ ★★★☆☆ Best on tripod/static scenes; use magnified view/peaking for precision. Hybrid (on-sensor) ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ ★★★★☆ Enable eye/face/animal detect; choose zone that fits subject size; refine with contrast AF if needed.Note: Many modern mirrorless cameras use on-sensor phase detection (PDAF) alongside contrast AF for hybrid performance.Modern cameras employ two primary autofocus (AF) systems: phase detection and contrast detection. These systems work in tandem to provide accurate and efficient focusing capabilities.PHASE DETECTIONPhase detection AF is a hardware-based system that uses an array of microlenses to split incoming light into pairs of images. By measuring the distance between these image pairs, the camera can determine whether the subject is front or back-focused. This information is then used to instruct the lens on how to adjust its focus accurately.The phase detection system works as follows: 1. Light enters the lens and is partially reflected by the primary mirror onto a dedicated AF sensor. 2. Microlenses on the AF sensor divide the light into pairs of images for each active AF point truct the lens on how to adjust its focus accurately.The phase detection system works as follows: 1. Light enters the lens and is partially reflected by the primary mirror onto a dedicated AF sensor. 2. Microlenses on the AF sensor divide the light into pairs of images for each active AF point. 3. The separation between these image pairs is analysed to calculate the required degree and direction of focus adjustment. 4. The camera instructs the lens to move its focus ring accordingly until the subject is perfectly sharp.Phase detection AF is swift and precise, making it ideal for tracking moving subjects in sports or wildlife photography.CONTRAST DETECTIONContrast detection AF relies on software algorithms to analyse the contrast levels within the image captured by the camera's main sensor. The system scans the scene, rapidly adjusting the lens focus until the highest contrast (sharpest detail) is achieved for the desired subject.While contrast detection AF is generally slower than phase detection, it offers superior accuracy for stationary subjects. It works by: 1. Evaluating the contrast levels across the image sensor. 2. Adjust the lens focus incrementally while monitoring contrast changes. 3. Locking focus when the maximum contrast is detected, indicating optimal sharpness.HYBRID SYSTEMSMany modern cameras combine phase detection and contrast detection AF into a hybrid system, leveraging the strengths of both technologies. This approach allows for fast and accurate focusing in various shooting scenarios.Hybrid AF systems can switch between phase detection for quick subject acquisition and contrast detection for precise fine-tuning. Some advanced implementations combine data from both systems simultaneously, resulting in exceptional autofocus performance.By understanding how these autofocus systems operate, photographers can better utilise their camera's capabilities and capture sharper, more compelling images.----------------------------------------BASIC CONCEPTS OF FOCUSQUICK TIPS — PLANE OF FOCUS & DEPTH OF FIELD * Plane of focus: the razor-sharp slice where light converges on the sensor. At wide apertures (e.g., f/1.4–f/2) it’s thin—place it on the critical detail (eyes for people, leading edge for wildlife). * Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: moving the camera changes focus distance. Move the AF point to the subject instead; use eye/face detect when reliable. * Three levers for DoF: aperture (smaller opening → more DoF), distance (farther → more DoF), focal length (shorter → more DoF). Use them together to get the look you want. * Practical starts: headshots f/2–f/2.8; couples f/2.8–f/4; small groups f/4–f/5.6; landscapes on tripod f/8–f/11 (watch diffraction if you stop down further). * Landscapes: prefer hyperfocal focusing (app/lens scale). If unsure, use f/8–f/11, focus slightly beyond the nearest important subject, and verify with magnified review—avoid the “one-third into the scene” myth. * Macro & close-ups: DoF collapses at close distance—stop down, align the subject with the focus plane, and consider focus stacking for full sharpness.Understanding the fundamental concepts of focus in photography, such as the plane of focus and depth of field, is essential for photographers aiming to enhance their visual storytelling and create compelling compositions. These concepts are intricately linked to how a photographer controls what appears sharp in an image and what is softened i cus in photography, such as the plane of focus and depth of field, is essential for photographers aiming to enhance their visual storytelling and create compelling compositions. These concepts are intricately linked to how a photographer controls what appears sharp in an image and what is softened into an out-of-focus blur, effectively directing the viewer's attention.PLANE OF FOCUSThe plane of focus is a critical concept in photography, referring to the specific area within a scene that is in sharp focus. It can be visualised as an imaginary line or plane that extends across the frame, parallel to the camera's sensor. When a camera lens is focused on a subject, this plane is perfectly sharp, and anything before or after this plane begins to lose sharpness, depending on the aperture setting.For instance, imagine positioning subjects along a straight line in an open field; if they align precisely with this focal plane, they will all appear sharply focused, even at a wide aperture like f1.4. However, if a subject moves slightly forward or backwards away from this line, it will fall out of focus. The width of this plane of focus can be adjusted by changing the aperture: a lower f-stop number (like f1.4) results in a narrower plane, while a higher f-stop number broadens the focus area.DEPTH OF FIELDDepth of field (DoF) describes the extent of the area in the photograph that appears acceptably sharp. It extends in front of and behind the plane of focus and is influenced by several factors, including aperture size, the distance between the camera and the subject, and the lens’s focal length. * Aperture: Smaller apertures (higher f-stop numbers) increase the depth of field, rendering a larger area of the scene in focus. Conversely, larger apertures (smaller f-stop numbers) create a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the plane of focus while blurring the foreground photography and background. * Distance to Subject: The closer the subject is to the camera, the shallower the depth of field. Moving the subject away from the camera increases the depth of field. * Focal Length: Longer focal lengths reduce the depth of field, making it easier to isolate the subject from distracting backgrounds with a pleasing blur. Shorter focal lengths increase the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus.By mastering these concepts, photographers can manipulate the plane of focus and depth of field to create images that isolate the subject dramatically or include detailed context by keeping the entire scene in sharp focus. Experimentation with these settings allows photographers to achieve their desired artistic effects, whether capturing the intricate details of a portrait or the expansive beauty of a landscape.----------------------------------------AUTOFOCUS MODES EXPLAINEDQUICK TIPS — AUTOFOCUS MODES EXPLAINED * Pick by motion: AF-S (One-Shot/Single-Shot) for static subjects; AF-C (AI Servo/Continuous AF) for anything moving. * How they behave: AF-S locks focus at half-press; AF-C updates continuously while you track—use burst for action. * Area matters: Single point for precision (eyes, small subjects); expanded/zone for erratic motion; wide/auto with eye/face/animal detect for people and wildlife. * Don’t recompose at shallow DoF: moving the camera changes focus distance. Move the AF point instead (or rely on eye detect) at f/1.4–f/2.8. * Back-button focus (BB",

LET'S DIVE IN!Congratulations on your new camera! Getting a new camera is exciting whether you're a budding photographer or just starting. But before snapping away, you should do a few essential things first to ensure you get the best out of your camera. In this guide, I will walk you through the ten essential things to do with your new camera. From updating the firmware to customizing function keys, these steps will help you optimize your camera settings and enhance your photography skills.10 TIPS FOR BASIC CAMERA SETTINGS FOR YOUR NEW CAMERA.----------------------------------------GET THE 1-PAGE CAMERA SETTINGS CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 guide — exposure modes, RAW vs JPEG, ISO limits, AF/drive modes, white balance & more.Download Camera Settings Checklist (PDF) 1-to-1 Zoom Help Prefer a text link? Download the Camera Settings Checklist (PDF) 1. UPDATE THE FIRMWAREThe first thing you should do when you get a new camera is to check if there are any firmware updates available. Firmware updates contain important improvements and bug fixes that can enhance the performance and functionality of your camera. The firmware is the operating system for your camera, much like Windows Or Mac IOS updates the camera OS for the latest updates. Manufacturers often update the firmware to include new functionality like focus stacking or changes to the bracketing range so it is certainly worthwhile checking on the manufacturers site to see what new features have been added since your camera was built and sat in a warehouse for x months!To update the firmware, visit the manufacturer's website and download the latest version for your camera model. Follow the instructions provided to install the update onto your camera. By keeping your camera's firmware up to date, you ensure that it is running smoothly and efficiently and it may also add new features and functions. It may provide new features and improvements to your basic camera settingsUpdate the Firmware2. SET YOUR DIOPTEROne of the most important things to do when you first get a new camera is to set your diopter. The diopter is a small adjustment that allows you to customize the viewfinder to match your eyesight. To set your diopter, look through the viewfinder and locate the diopter adjustment dial, usually located near the viewfinder. Adjust the dial until the text and numbers in along the bottom of the viewfinder appear sharp and clear. This will ensure a clear and accurate view of your subject when composing your shots.Set Your Diopter3. SELECT IMAGE QUALITYTo get the best results from your camera, it's important to select the right image quality settings. Most cameras offer a range of image quality options, such as JPEG, RAW, or both. JPEG is a compressed file format that is ideal for sharing and printing photos directly from the camera. RAW, on the other hand, is an uncompressed file format that captures all the data from the camera's sensor, al gs. Most cameras offer a range of image quality options, such as JPEG, RAW, or both. JPEG is a compressed file format that is ideal for sharing and printing photos directly from the camera. RAW, on the other hand, is an uncompressed file format that captures all the data from the camera's sensor, allowing for greater flexibility in post-processing. If you are serious about photography and plan on editing your photos, shooting in RAW is recommended. However, if you prefer the basic camera settings and convenience of ready-to-use images, JPEG is a good option, but always go for the maximum size and quality in JPG mode so you have the option to reduce size if needed.4. READ THE MANUAL OR WATCH YOUTUBE FOR YOUR MODELWhile it may seem tempting to dive right in and start shooting, reading the manual or watching tutorial videos for your specific camera model can make a world of difference. The manual will provide valuable information about your basic camera settings, different features and functions, and tips for achieving optimal results. Additionally, YouTube is a treasure trove of tutorials and guides created by experienced photographers and camera enthusiasts. Watching these videos can help you familiarize yourself with your camera's advanced settings and capabilities, giving you a head start in your photography journey. Whenever I upgrade my camera body, I will spend several hours trawling through YouTube Videos to explain specific camera menu options to understand what settings suit me for different situations. Knowing what each function does in your camera is worth that investment in time. It increases your confidence in using your camera and helps you decide if specific basic camera settings may be helpful in certain situations, which you can save as a custom user preset. See Point 10. Save Camera Settings to Custom for Different Shooting Situations5. LEARN HOW TO USE QUICK MENU FUNCTIONSMost cameras come equipped with a quick menu that allows you to access frequently used settings with ease. Familiarising yourself with the quick menu functions will save you time and help you quickly adjust settings on the go. Standard quick menu functions include ISO, white balance, exposure compensation, and drive mode. Experiment with these settings and understand how they affect your images. You can capture the perfect shot in any situation by mastering the quick menu functions. Many modern cameras also allow you to configure and change the quick menu , metering, focusing, and other basic camera settings that you want to access without delving into menu systems. On the Sony, it’s the Fn key, Canon the Q key and Nikon “i” keyQuick Menu Functions6. LEARN HOW TO CHANGE AUTO FOCUS SETTINGSAuto focus is a powerful tool that can help you achieve sharp and well-focused images. Understanding how to change the auto focus settings on your camera will allow you to adapt to different shooting scenarios. Experiment with different auto focus modes, such as single point, zone, or tracking, to see which one works best for your subject. Additionally, learning how to manually override the auto focus and fine-tune your focus point will give you more control over your images. Take the time to practice and experiment with the auto focus settings to improve your photography skills. There are two settings to look at. Focus Mode which sets whether single shot or continuous focusing and Focus Area which is more important when you want to pinpoint where t rol over your images. Take the time to practice and experiment with the auto focus settings to improve your photography skills. There are two settings to look at. Focus Mode which sets whether single shot or continuous focusing and Focus Area which is more important when you want to pinpoint where to focus in the frame rather than allow the camera to decide for you.7. LEARN EXPOSURE SETTINGSUnderstanding exposure is crucial in photography. The exposure settings determine how light or dark your image will be. The three main components of exposure are aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Aperture controls the amount of light that enters the camera through the lens, shutter speed determines how long the camera's sensor is exposed to light, and ISO measures the sensor's sensitivity to light. By learning how to adjust these settings, you can achieve the desired exposure for your photos. Experiment with different exposure settings to see their effects on your images and develop your style and use of the camera. This is the subject that the majority of newbies struggle with, and that’s why I provide a 5-week beginners photography course made up of five weekly two-hour lessons to teach you to understand the exposure triangle and when to use different exposure settings to deal with the light and the subject you’re photographing. My photography classes cover all the main basic camera settings you need.8. LEARN ABOUT DRIVE MODESDrive modes determine how your camera captures multiple images in succession. Understanding the different drive modes will enable you to capture fast-moving subjects or create stunning time-lapse sequences. Common drive modes include single shot, continuous shooting, self-timer, and interval shooting. Experiment with these modes to see how they can enhance your photography. By mastering drive modes, you'll be able to capture the perfect moment and create images that capture a split second in time.Drive Modes9. CUSTOMIZE FUNCTION KEYSCustomizing function keys allows you to personalize your camera settings and access frequently used features quickly. Most cameras offer the ability to assign specific functions to different buttons on the camera body. For example, you can assign aspect ratio or other basic camera settings to a function button for easy access. Take the time to explore the customization options available on your camera and set up the function keys according to your preferences. This will streamline your workflow and make shooting more efficient.Example of customisable buttons on a Sony. Other camera will have similar options to configure.10. SAVE CAMERA SETTINGS TO CUSTOM FOR DIFFERENT SHOOTING SITUATIONSOnce you've mastered the various camera settings, it's a good idea to save them as custom presets for different shooting situations. For example, you can save one preset for landscape photography and another for low-light conditions. and so on. By saving your preferred settings, you can quickly switch between presets without having to manually adjust each setting. This will save you time and ensure that you're always ready to capture the perfect shot in any situation.I have three different shooting presets saved on my camera. 1. General - Landscapes / Outdoors 2. Portraits 3. Wildlife / Fast moving subjects Each preset has slightly different settings for: * metering (spot or evaluative) , drive mode (burst or one-shot), exposure mo tion.I have three different shooting presets saved on my camera. 1.

High-quality product images serve as a key driver of customer engagement and play a critical role in building a solid brand presence. This section explores the multifaceted importance of product photography in online retail environments.THE IMPACT ON SALES AND CUSTOMER DECISIONSA compelling product image can make or break a customer's decision to purchase. Studies, such as those conducted by Etsy and Shopify, reveal that nearly 90% of consumers consider the quality of product photos extremely important in their purchasing decisions, and products with high-quality images see up to 94% higher conversion rates. These statistics underscore the direct correlation between the quality of product photography and e-commerce success. Customers rely heavily on visuals to assess products, given the absence of physical interaction. Clear, detailed, and attractive product images help bridge the gap between online browsing and the tactile shopping experience, thereby enhancing consumer confidence and encouraging purchase decisions.BUILDING BRAND IDENTITY AND TRUSTProduct photography extends beyond the mere representation of items; it is instrumental in crafting and reinforcing brand identity. Consistent, high-quality images reflect a brand's commitment to quality and reliability, shaping consumer perceptions and fostering a sense of trust. This trust is crucial in a competitive market where consumers have endless options. By maintaining a consistent visual style, brands can create a recognisable aesthetic that resonates with their target audience, making the brand more memorable and likely to attract repeat customers.REDUCING RETURNS AND ENHANCING CUSTOMER SATISFACTIONAccurate and detailed product photography helps set realistic expectations for customers, reducing the likelihood of returns. By providing a true-to-life portrayal of products, e-commerce platforms can minimise discrepancies between how an item appears online and its real-world appearance. This transparency improves customer satisfaction and decreases the logistical and financial burdens associated with high return rates.LEVERAGING VIS rue-to-life portrayal of products, e-commerce platforms can minimise discrepancies between how an item appears online and its real-world appearance. This transparency improves customer satisfaction and decreases the logistical and financial burdens associated with high return rates.LEVERAGING VISUAL CONTENT FOR MARKETINGIn today's digital age, visual content is king. High-quality product photos are inherently shareable, making them powerful tools for online marketing. Engaging images can be used across various platforms, from the brand's website to social media channels, enhancing visibility and engagement. Additionally, compelling photographs can attract more traffic to e-commerce sites, boost search engine optimisation (SEO), and generate more leads and sales.E-COMMERCE SUMMARYThe strategic integration of high-quality product photography into e-commerce operations is not just advisable; it is essential. It influences consumer behaviour, enhances brand perception, and ultimately drives sales. As the e-commerce landscape continues to evolve, the role of product photography becomes increasingly central, not just for surviving but for thriving in an increasingly visual and competitive market.Mobile Fast Food Truck - Product ShootGRAB THE 1-PAGE PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHY SETUP CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 setup — soft light, glare control, accurate colour.Download Product Setup Checklist (PDF) Book 1-to-1 Product Help (Zoom) Hire Me to Shoot Your Products Prefer a text link? Download the Product Setup Checklist (PDF) ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT FOR BEGINNERSEmbarking on the journey of product photography requires a robust setup, especially for beginners aiming to achieve professional product photography results. Here, we outline the essential equipment needed to get started, ensuring you have the right tools to create stunning, high-quality product images.CHOOSING THE RIGHT CAMERAFor beginners, the choice of camera is pivotal. While smartphones and point-and-shoot cameras offer convenience, they often fall short in flexibility and image quality under varying lighting conditions. Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR camera) cameras are recommended for their versatility and ability to use different lenses. Entry-level DSLR cameras provide a great balance of quality, ease of use, and access to various lenses for different photography needs, such as macro lenses for detailed shots. A smartphone camera can also be used for product photography at home if you're just starting out and don't want to invest in a DSLR camera right away or you are not shooting for commercial use.SELECTING TRIPODSA sturdy tripod is essential for maintaining camera stability and achieving sharp images. Tripods help in precise framing and are invaluable in low light conditions or when using slow shutter speeds to avoid camera shake. Models away or you are not shooting for commercial use.SELECTING TRIPODSA sturdy tripod is essential for maintaining camera stability and achieving sharp images. Tripods help in precise framing and are invaluable in low light conditions or when using slow shutter speeds to avoid camera shake. Models like the Manfrotto 055 are highly recommended due to their robustness and flexibility, allowing product photographers to capture images from various angles without sacrificing image quality. Your tripod legs should be capable of getting as low as ground level and the tripod and head should be capable of being able to shoot overhead with the camera facing down. I have written various posts on using tripods on my blog page, so take a look at those and which tripods I recommend .Shooting OverheadLIGHTING GEARProper lighting is crucial in product photography. Beginners should consider starting with a basic two-light setup, using softboxes to evenly light the product from both sides. This setup helps eliminate harsh shadows and provides a clean, professional look. Continuous lighting kits, such as the EzyLite 4 Head Kit , are particularly user-friendly and affordable for beginners, offering a simple setup and consistent lighting. A light tent or light box can also be useful for DIY product photography to diffuse the light and reduce shadows. I prefer to use my Godox V860iii flash either mounted to the camera hot shoe but diffused and directed or with a softbox/umbrella , depending on the product being photographed. Remember you will also need a S-type Bracket Speedlight Bowens Mount and lighting stand if using the flash off camera. I have put together a list of items you may want to shop for in this storefront on Amazon BACKDROP ESSENTIALSChoosing the right backdrop can dramatically affect the appearance and professionalism of your product photos. Seamless paper backgrounds are popular due to their affordability and wide range of colors. Options like Savage's 01 Super White provide a clean, distraction-free background, ideal for ecommerce product photography and online stores. For more durability and a different esthetic, canvas or muslin backdrops can be used, especially in settings where a more textured background is desired. A shooting table can also be a helpful tool to provide a stable surface for your products and backdrops. Take a look in recommended product photography equipment storefront for possible ideas.SOFTWARE FOR EDITINGPost-production plays a significant role in product photography. Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom remains the industry standard for photo editing, offering comprehensive tools for detailed retouching and creative adjustments. Beginners might find Photoshop complex, but it's invaluable for achieving professional-grade results. For those seeking simpler software, Adobe Lightroom offers intuitive controls and powerful editing capabilities without the steep learning curve of Photoshop. Both programs offer tools for colour correction and image optimisation t mplex, but it's invaluable for achieving professional-grade results. For those seeking simpler software, Adobe Lightroom offers intuitive controls and powerful editing capabilities without the steep learning curve of Photoshop. Both programs offer tools for colour correction and image optimisation to ensure your product images look their best. If you require some training on getting the best from Adobe Lightroom, take a look at my photo editing evening classes or if you are not local to me, I can provide similar Lightroom training online using Zoom .By equipping yourself with the right camera, tripod, lighting, backdrops, and editing software, you can start your product photography journey with confidence, ready to create compelling images that enhance your e-commerce presence.PRE-PHOTOSHOOT PREPARATIONSPRE-PHOTOSHOOT PREPARATIONSPLAN & PRODUCT * Define goal & specs: platform size/aspect, white background rules, margins, file type. * Shot list: hero, 45°, front/back, details, scale, lifestyle; note any reflections to manage. * Naming & folders: create capture/output folders; file pattern SKU_product-angle_####. * Prepare products: clean/polish; remove dust/labels; fix dents; bring duplicates/spares. * Styling kit: lint roller, gloves, microfiber cloths, Blu-Tack, clear fishing line, clamps, gaffer tape. * Colour control: grey card + colour target ready for the first frame.CAMERA & LIGHTING * Camera setup: RAW, base ISO 100, manual WB (from target), single-point AF; timer/remote or tether. * Lenses & cleaning: normal/macro lens; clean glass/sensor; pack caps and blower. * Stability: level tripod; set working height; mark product position on table. * Background: white sweep curved (spare paper); acrylic/plexi if reflections are desired. * Lighting plan: choose continuous or flash; softbox/diffusion panels; white reflectors; black flags; test polariser. * Power & spares: charged batteries, formatted cards, extension leads, tape-down for safety.SETTING UP YOUR SPACEBefore diving into the actual product photoshoot, photographers must meticulously prepare their workspace. This involves selecting an area with adequate room for all equipment and ensuring that the environment can be controlled for consistent results. A well-organised space not only facilitates a smoother workflow but also minimises potential disruptions during the shoot. It's advisable to have a clean, clutter-free area where the focus remains solely on the product. For those working in smaller spaces, innovative solutions such as using a curtain pole to hang backdrops can save space and cost effectively.ADJUSTING LIGHTINGLighting is the cornerstone of product photography, profoundly impacting the quality of the final images. Beginners should start with a basic lighting setup, utilising continuous lighting with daylight bulbs to mimic natural light. This setup should include key lights, fill lights, and possibly backlights to enhance the product's dimensions and texture. The key light, typically positioned at a 45-degree angle from the camera, sets the tone and contrast, while the fill light helps soften shadows. Backlighting can be used to outline the product, adding depth of field to the images. Adjusting the intensity and position of these lights is crucial; too close may result in harsh shadows, while too far could flatten the product's appearance. there are multiple light",

By understanding these p subject matter or style.This guide delves into the essentials of compositional balance, exploring various photography techniques to enhance photographic compositions. It covers critical concepts such as symmetry, the golden ratio, and balancing elements of different sizes. By understanding these principles and geometric principles, photographers can develop their skills to create more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing images with harmonious proportions. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refine your technique, this guide offers valuable insights to elevate your photography and unleash your creative potential.COMPOSE WITH VISION, NOT JUST TECHNIQUEComposition isn’t about rule-following. It’s about story-shaping. The camera captures—but you compose meaning through balance, light, framing, and intention. Great composition begins with seeing—pausing, observing, and feeling before pressing the shutter. From that place, choose your method (symmetry, asymmetry, golden ratio, size balance) to guide the viewer's inner journey, not just their eyes. * Symmetry — mirror forms for calm structure; break slightly to maintain flow. * Asymmetry — offset weight with tone or scale; use diagonals for energy. * Golden Ratio — spiral or phi grid naturally guide the viewer’s path. * Size Balance — counterbalance mass with colour, detail, or open space. * Observe First — don’t shoot; pause. Feel the light, mood, relationships. * Intent Matters — every element should serve purpose and emotion. * Style Emerges in Repetition — your voice lives in your choices frame after frame. * Slow Down — clarity comes with focus, patience, and invisible control.SYMMETRY IN COMPOSITIONAL BALANCESymmetry plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and balanced compositions in photography. It influences how viewers perceive and connect with images, often evoking feelings of formality, elegance, and harmony. Photographers can harness the power of symmetry to guide the viewer's eye and create a sense of order within their image framing.QUICK TIPS — SYMMETRY IN COMPOSITIONAL BALANCEFIND NATURAL SYMMETRY * Reflection: Use water, glass, polished floors for mirror-like scenes. * Rotational: Look for petals, spirals, radial patterns from a centre. * Translational: Spot repeating forms—fences, windows, columns. * Scan for shapes: Hunt clean axes, repeated lines, and tidy edges.CREATE SYMMETRY BY FRAMING * Central axis: Place the main subject dead-centre with intent. * Balance weight: Match visual mass on left/right (tone, colour, size). * Lead the eye: Align paths, corridors, or horizons to the centre line. * Depth symmetry: Echo elements foreground → background for 3D balance.WHEN TO BREAK SYMMETRY * Add energy: Introduce a small off-centre element to avoid a static feel. * Direct focus: Break symmetry where you want attention to land first. * Keep it real: Slight imperfections often feel more authentic and engaging.FINDING NATURAL SYMMETRYNatural symmetry abounds in the world around us. Photographers can spot it in various forms: 1. Reflection symmetry: Often seen in water reflections, this type of symmetry mirrors elements around a central axis. 2. Rotational symmetry: Found in subjects like flowers, where elements rotate around a common centre, creating mesmerising natural patterns. 3. Translational symmetry: Observed in repeating patterns, such as fence posts or architectural features with intersecting lines.T around a central axis. 2. Rotational symmetry: Found in subjects like flowers, where elements rotate around a common centre, creating mesmerising natural patterns. 3. Translational symmetry: Observed in repeating patterns, such as fence posts or architectural features with intersecting lines.To effectively capture natural symmetry, photographers should look for reflective surfaces, geometric shapes in architecture, and patterns in nature. Water bodies, polished floors, and even sunglasses can offer opportunities for creating symmetrical compositions, as renowned photographers like Henri Cartier-Bresson and Ansel Adams masterfully demonstrate.CREATING SYMMETRY THROUGH FRAMINGPhotographers can actively create symmetry in their images through careful framing and composition techniques: 1. Central axis focus: Place the subject at the heart of the frame, commanding the viewer's attention. 2. Balanced elements: Ensure visual elements on both sides of the central axis have equal weight. 3. Leading lines: Use centred lines and patterns to guide the viewer's gaze towards the focal subject . 4. Depth symmetry: Arrange elements from foreground to background symmetrically, creating multi-dimensional balance.When framing for symmetry, photographers should pay attention to crisp lines, well-defined shapes, and the repetition of elements within the frame. This deliberate arrangement contributes to the golden ratio image's overall sense of balance and harmony.WHEN TO BREAK THE SYMMETRYWhile symmetry can create visually striking golden ratio images, it's essential to know when to break it: 1. To add interest: Perfect symmetry can sometimes appear static or dull. Introducing a slight asymmetrical element can make the golden ratio composition more dynamic. 2. To create focus: Breaking symmetry in one area of the golden ratio photo can draw attention to a specific subject or element. 3. To enhance realism: Since perfect symmetry is uncommon, breaking it slightly can add a sense of authenticity to the golden ratio picture.By thoughtfully incorporating or breaking symmetry, photographers can create compositions that are not only visually pleasing but also emotionally impactful. These compositions guide the viewer's eye and effectively convey their intended message. This approach to photography is exemplified in the works of masters like Annie Liebovitz.QUICK TIPS — ASYMMETRY FOR DYNAMIC BALANCEUSE UNEQUAL ELEMENTS * Size contrast: Balance a large object with several smaller ones. * Tonal weight: Offset dark areas with bright highlights or colour pops. * Position: Place a strong subject near one edge, counterweighted by space. * Texture & detail: A busy area can counter a simpler negative space.CREATE ENERGY & FLOW * Diagonal balance: Place elements opposite corners for tension. * Rule of thirds: Position subjects off-centre to lead the eye naturally. * Implied lines: Use gaze, movement, or perspective to connect areas. * Dynamic tension: Let imbalance create drama, movement, or intrigue.TIPS FOR CONTROL * Check edges — avoid clutter that unbalances the frame. * Squint test — see if visual weight feels equal despite asymmetry. * Use cropping to fine-tune the push-and-pull of elements.THE GOLDEN RATIO IN PHOTOGRAPHYThe golden ratio, a mathematical ratio with a value of approximately 1.618:1, influences the creation of visually appealing and balanced co uint test — see if visual weight feels equal despite asymmetry. * Use cropping to fine-tune the push-and-pull of elements.THE GOLDEN RATIO IN PHOTOGRAPHYThe golden ratio, a mathematical ratio with a value of approximately 1.618:1, influences the creation of visually appealing and balanced compositions in golden ratio photography. This principle, represented by the Greek letter phi (φ), is found in nature, art, and architecture and has been used by artists for centuries to craft aesthetically pleasing works with harmonious proportions. Also known as the golden mean or divine proportion, the golden ratio is a powerful tool for photographers seeking to elevate their craft.QUICK TIPS — GOLDEN RATIO IN PHOTOGRAPHYUSE THE GOLDEN SPIRAL * Construct the spiral with Fibonacci squares and curves. * Guide the eye inward along the curve to the subject. * Place your main focal point at the spiral’s origin.APPLY TO LANDSCAPES * Use a golden ratio grid (≈1.618:1) to divide the frame. * Align horizons with the golden horizontal lines. * Position key features where lines intersect.WORK WITH THE PHI GRID * Enable a golden ratio (phi) overlay in your camera app. * Align subjects and curves along grid lines or intersections. * Keep horizons level; use the central narrow band for tension.The Golden Ratio is a number that's (kind of) equal to 1.618, just like pi is approximately equal to 3.14, but not exactly. You take a line and divide it into two parts – a long part (a) and a short part (b). The entire length (a + b) divided by (a) is equal to (a) divided by (b). And both of those numbers equal 1.618UNDERSTANDING THE GOLDEN SPIRALThe golden spiral, derived from the Fibonacci sequence, is a powerful tool for photographers to create dynamic compositions in golden spiral photography. To construct this Fibonacci spiral: 1. Draw a series of squares based on the Fibonacci sequence 1. Connect the corners of these squares with a curve 1. The resulting golden spiral in photography guides the viewer's eye through the imagePhotographers can use this Fibonacci spiral to lead the viewer's attention to the main subject, typically placed at the centre of the smallest square or at the spiral's origin.APPLYING THE GOLDEN RATIO TO LANDSCAPESLandscape photography particularly benefits from the golden ratio: 1. Divide the frame using the golden ratio grid (1.618:1 ratio) 1. Place the horizon along one of the horizontal lines 1. Position key elements at the intersections of these linesThis approach creates a more natural and harmonious balance compared to the rule of thirds, especially in scenes with strong leading lines or when capturing seascapes with colourful sunsets.USING THE PHI GRIDThe golden ratio overlay, also known as the phi grid, is similar to the rule of thirds but aligns with the golden ratio: 1. Open a camera app with a golden ratio grid overlay 2. Position the main subject along the grid lines or at intersections 3. Align natural curves or leading lines with the gridRule of Thirds, Phi Grid, Symmetry, Fibonacci Spiral, Golden Triangle, Vanishing PointThis method helps photographers create balanced compositions while maintaining a level horizon. The slight tension introduced by the smaller middle section adds a dynamic element to the golden ratio image, holding the viewer's attention.By incorporating the golden ratio into their work, photographers can create more visually pleasing and im ced compositions while maintaining a level horizon. The slight tension introduced by the smaller middle section adds a dynamic element to the golden ratio image, holding the viewer's attention.By incorporating the golden ratio into their work, photographers can create more visually pleasing and impactful images that naturally draw the viewer's eye to the intended focal points. The golden ratio is a powerful tool for achieving aesthetics and proportion in photography.BALANCING ELEMENTS OF DIFFERENT SIZESQUICK TIPS — BALANCING ELEMENTS OF DIFFERENT SIZESUNDERSTAND VISUAL MASS * Larger objects pull more attention than smaller ones. * Light tones, bright colours, and strong shapes increase weight. * Balance the whole frame — avoid one area dominating.BALANCE UNEQUAL ELEMENTS * Negative space: Use emptiness to counter visual weight. * Tonal contrast: A small light area can offset a large dark one. * Asymmetry: Distribute weight unevenly for dynamic tension. * Scale & proportion: Vary sizes to guide the eye and set hierarchy.CREATE HARMONY WITH SIZE VARIATION * Foreground vs background: balance near subjects with distant blur. * Play with scale: exaggerate size to emphasise or create effect. * Counterbalance: small details can offset large empty expanses (e.g., sky vs rock).THE CONCEPT OF VISUAL MASSVisual mass is a crucial concept in compositional balance. It refers to the capacity of an element to attract the viewer's attention. Larger objects typically have more visual weight than smaller ones, but other factors such as colour, tone, and shape also contribute. Light tones, for instance, have more visual mass than dark tones, naturally drawing the eye to highlights in a golden ratio photo.Understanding visual mass helps photographers decide where to place subjects within the frame. Rather than rigidly adhering to the golden rule of photography, it's beneficial to consider the entire frame and how all elements interact. This approach ensures that no single area overpowers others, creating a seamless whole where everything works together harmoniously.Balancing Visual MassTECHNIQUES FOR BALANCING UNEQUAL ELEMENTSBalancing elements of different sizes requires careful consideration of their visual weight. Here are some techniques to achieve this: 1. Use negative space : Arrange both positive elements and negative space to create equilibrium. 2. Employ tonal contrast : Balance light and dark tones. For example, a small area of light tone can balance a larger area of dark tone. 3. Utilise asymmetry: Create dynamic compositions by distributing visual weight unequally but maintaining overall balance, as seen in the golden triangle composition. 4. Consider scale and proportion in photography: Vary the sizes of elements to establish hierarchy and guide the viewer's attention.CREATING HARMONY WITH SIZE VARIATIONSize variation can create visual interest and depth in a composition. To create harmony: 1. Use the foreground and background: Place the primary object in the foreground and balance it with blurred elements in the background. 2. Play with scale: Make certain elements disproportionately large or small to draw attention or create a unique effect, as exemplified in the golden section photography. 3. Balance large expanses with smaller, detailed areas: For instance, in landscape photography, a small, detai",

MASTER CONTRAST TO CONTROL MOOD, DEPTH AND ATTENTION — IN MINUTES, NOT MONTHS.Contrast in photography describes the difference between light and dark tones, colours or textures in an image—shaping mood, depth and visual impact.3 key takeaways * Tonal contrast: Difference between highlights and shadows for dramatic or soft results. * Colour contrast: Warm vs cool, complementary colours add energy or harmony. * Conceptual contrast: Juxtaposing subjects or ideas creates storytelling tension.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS CONTRAST IN PHOTOGRAPHY?Contrast in photography is a powerful tool that can make or break an image. It's the difference between light and dark areas in a photo that shapes the visual impact and mood of the final result. Understanding contrast and how to use it effectively can transform ordinary shots into striking photographs that grab the viewer's attention and convey powerful emotions.This guide delves into the world of what is contrast in photography, covering everything from the basics to advanced techniques. It explores tonal contrast, which deals with the interplay of highlights and shadows, as well as colour contrast photography, which focuses on the relationships between different hues. Readers will learn about high-key and low-key lighting, the dramatic effect of high contras to advanced techniques. It explores tonal contrast, which deals with the interplay of highlights and shadows, as well as colour contrast photography, which focuses on the relationships between different hues. Readers will learn about high-key and low-key lighting, the dramatic effect of high contrast photography in black and white, and how to use contrast to enhance composition and create visual interest in their photos.Contrast Type What it Means Visual Effect When to Use Tonal Contrast Light vs dark tones Strong depth, dramatic look Black & white, high drama shots Colour Contrast Opposing hues on the colour wheel Vibrant, eye-catching Landscapes, street scenes Textural Contrast Smooth vs rough surfaces Adds detail & interest Macro, nature, architecture Conceptual Contrast Juxtaposition of ideas Storytelling power Documentary, fine art High Contrast Large differences in tones/colours Bold, punchy Graphic, abstract styles Low Contrast Subtle differences in tones/colours Soft, muted, dreamy Misty, pastel, minimalist workQUICK TIPSSPOTTING HIGH CONTRAST * Squint at the scene — big gaps between light & dark = high contrast. * Look for hard-edged shadows, midday sun, backlit subjects. * Great for bold B&W and graphic shapes.SPOTTING LOW CONTRAST * Mist, overcast light, pastel palettes and gentle tonal steps. * Soft shadows; edges look “melted” rather than crisp. * Perfect for mood, minimalism and subtle colour harmony.CAPTURE * Expose for highlights in high-contrast scenes; keep detail in bright areas. * Use side-light to emphasise texture (rocks, bark, architecture). * Place complementary colours side-by-side to boost colour contrast.COMPOSE * Put your highest contrast at or near the subject for instant emphasis. * Simplify backgrounds; reduce competing bright spots. * Decide the mood first: punchy (high) or gentle (low).THE BASICS OF CONTRAST IN PHOTOGRAPHYWHAT IS CONTRAST?Contrast meaning in photography refers to the visual ratio of different tones in an image. It refers to the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of a photograph, which creates textures, highlights, shadows, colours, and clarity. This difference is what makes objects in an image distinguishable, forming the basis of photography since its inception.HOW CONTRAST AFFECTS IMAGESContrast photography plays a crucial role in shaping the visual impact and mood of a photograph. High-contrast images have a wide range of tones, full of blacks and whites with dark shadows and bright highlights. These contrast photos often feature intense colours and deep textures, resulting in profound end results. On the other hand, low contrast photography blends light and dark areas, creating a softer or flatter appearance. They have fewer highlights and shadows, with the composition mostly in shades of grey, which can mute the colours in the image.CONTRAST TYPES AT A GLANCETONALDifference between highlights and shadows; controls punch vs softness.Try: backlit silhouettes, midday shadows, sunrise/sunset scenes.COLOURWarm vs cool or complementary hues for energy or harmony.Try: golden leaves vs blue sky, red against green, teal/orange city light.TEXTURALSmooth vs rough surfaces to add depth and tactile interest.Try: rocks vs water, bark vs moss, fabric vs metal.CONCEPTUALJuxtapose ideas/subjects to create narrative tension.Try: old vs new architecture, nature vs man‑made, calm vs chaos.View fullsizeHigh Contr nge city light.TEXTURALSmooth vs rough surfaces to add depth and tactile interest.Try: rocks vs water, bark vs moss, fabric vs metal.CONCEPTUALJuxtapose ideas/subjects to create narrative tension.Try: old vs new architecture, nature vs man‑made, calm vs chaos.View fullsizeHigh Contrast - bright highlights dark shadowsView fullsizeLow contrast - mainly mid-tonesTHE ROLE OF LIGHT IN CONTRASTLight is fundamental to creating contrast in photography. The interplay between light and shadow determines the visual ratio of different tones in an image. Photographers can manipulate light to reduce or increase contrast in specific parts of their images. The position and quality of light can affect numerous aspects of the final image, from clarity to tone to emotion.To use contrast effectively, photographers should pay close attention to where the brightest highlights and darkest shadows are in every image they capture. By understanding how light plays off the angles and curves of the subject and which parts are illuminated or in darkness, photographers can harness their light source in the most effective way for any given composition and project.EXPLORING TONAL CONTRASTBLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHYBlack and white high contrast photography strips an image down to its bare essentials, allowing photographers to tell a story using only light and shadow. Without the distraction of colours, the viewer's attention is drawn directly to the subject, the composition, and, most importantly, the contrast. In black and white images, contrast plays a star role, setting the mood and directing the viewer's gaze. High-contrast images often feel dramatic and intense, while those with soft contrast exude a more serene and dreamy ambiance.High Contrast B&WGRAYSCALE AND SHADOWSTonal contrast in photography refers to the difference in luminance values between various areas of a photograph. It exists to draw attention to contrasting elements like shadows and highlights, guiding the viewer's eyes around the image. The greater the tonal contrast between two areas, the stronger the visual separation. People tend to focus on areas with the highest levels of contrast, making it a powerful tool for creating visual hierarchy and emphasis.CREATING DEPTH WITH TONESTonal contrasts between dark and light sections amplify the shapes and lines in a photograph, creating a sense of depth and dimension. High-contrast scenarios in black and white photographs give our eyes vital clues about depth, with shadows indicating recesses and highlighted areas signifying protruding elements. This depth creates a more immersive viewing experience. To achieve striking tonal contrast, photographers can use techniques such as placing objects with different brightness levels side by side or manipulating contrast in post-production using editing software. However, it's crucial to maintain a balance, as too little contrast can result in a dull image, while too much can lead to loss of detail.Tonal Contrast PerceptionTonal Contrast PerceptionWANT TO MASTER CONTRAST IN YOUR SHOTS?Control light, colour & texture.

Download Free Contrast Guide (PDF) MASTERING COLOUR CONTRASTCOMPLEMENTARY COLOURSComplementary colours are pairs of hues that sit opposite each other on the colour wheel. These combinations, such as red and green, blue and orange, or yellow and purple, create maximum contrast in photography. This colour contrast draws the viewer's attention and can significantly impact the mood and perception of an image. For instance, the naturally occurring complementary colours of a sunset, with orange hues blending into the deep blue of the early night sky, create a visually striking scene.WARM VS COOL TONESColour temperature plays a vital role in evoking specific moods or emotions in photography. Warm colours, such as red and orange, tend to create a sense of comfort, happiness, and intimacy. These hues are often used in portrait photography to capture the warmth of human relationships. On the other hand, cool colours like blue and green can evoke feelings of calmness, serenity, and tranquillity, making them ideal for landscape and nature photography to capture the peacefulness of nature.Photographers can manipulate colour temperature to create a desired mood by adjusting the white balance settings on their camera or in post-production software. For example, setting a lower Kelvin temperature (around 3200K) can create a warm, inviting atmosphere in a portrait. In comparison, a higher temperature (about 5500K) can enhance the vibrancy of blues and greens in a landscape photo.USING THE COLOUR WHEELA colour wheel is an essential tool for photographers to understand and effectively use colour relationships. It helps identify complementary and harmonious colour schemes based on colour theory. To find complementary colours, simply choose a colour on the wheel and locate the one directly opposite. For a less intense contrast, photographers can use a split-complementary scheme by selecting a main colour and the two colours adjacent to its complement.When planning a shoot, creating a mood board using paint sample cards can help visualise colour combinations and inspire creative compositions. Remember that colours are relative, and their impact depends on how they are placed in relation to one another within the frame.View fullsizeBlue and Orange complimentary coloursADVANCED CONTRAST TECHNIQUESHIGH KEY AND LOW KEY LIGHTINGHigh key lighting creates bright images with a dominance of light tones and minimal contrast. It's ideal for conveying positive or neutral emotions, often used in professional headshots or school photos. Low key lighting, on the other hand, produces dark images with high contrast, creating a dramatic and intense atmosphere. It ty t images with a dominance of light tones and minimal contrast. It's ideal for conveying positive or neutral emotions, often used in professional headshots or school photos. Low key lighting, on the other hand, produces dark images with high contrast, creating a dramatic and intense atmosphere. It typically uses a single light source to highlight part of the subject, keeping the rest in shadows. This technique is effective for conveying complex emotions or creating a moody ambiance.High KeyLow KeySILHOUETTES AND BACKLIGHTINGSilhouette photography involves placing a light source behind the subject, creating a dark outline against a bright background. This technique can add drama and intrigue to an image. The best time for silhouette shots is early morning or late evening when the sun is low on the horizon. To achieve a striking silhouette, ensure your subject has a distinct shape and use a plain, bright background. Backlighting can also enhance mood and create a sense of depth in photographs.HDR PHOTOGRAPHYHigh Dynamic Range (HDR) photography is a technique that combines multiple exposures of the same scene to capture a wider range of tones and details. This method is particularly useful when a single exposure cannot adequately capture both highlights and shadows. HDR is commonly used in landscape, real estate, and architectural photography. It allows photographers to create images that more closely resemble what the human eye sees, with well-exposed shadows, midtones, and highlights. However, it's crucial to use HDR techniques judiciously to avoid unnatural-looking results.EDITING TIPS (5 MINUTES) * Curves: Set your black/white points; add a gentle S-curve for pop without clipping. * Local contrast: Use Clarity/Texture sparingly on focal areas—avoid global halos. * Split-tone / Color Grade: Nudge highlights vs shadows (warm/cool) to enhance colour contrast. * Dodge & Burn: Subtly brighten the subject path and tame distractions to guide the eye.CONCLUSIONMastering contrast in photography opens up a world of creative possibilities. By understanding how to manipulate light and shadows, tone, and colour, photographers can create images that truly stand out. From the dramatic impact of high-contrast black-and-white shots to the subtle interplay of complementary colours, the contrast has a profound influence on the mood and perception of a photograph. It's a powerful tool to guide the viewer's eye to the focal point and enhance the overall composition.The techniques discussed in this guide offer a starting point to explore and experiment with contrast. Whether you're working with tonal contrasts in black and white photography or playing with colour relationships, the key is to practise and develop your own style. Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach – the most effective use of contrast often depends on the subject, the lighting conditions, and the story you want to tell through your images. So grab your camera, try out these concepts, and see how contrast can transform your photography.----------------------------------------FAQS - WHAT IS CONTRAST IN PHOTOGRAPHYWhat does contrast mean in the context of photography?Contrast definition photography refers to the range of light intensity from the brightest to the darkest areas within an image.

MESSENGER BAG: THE IDEAL COMPANION FOR DAY TRIPS For day trips or outings, a messenger-style bag is ferent photographic scenarios, drawing from my personal experiences in the field.View fullsizeMessenger BagView fullsizeSmall BackpackView fullsizeLarger Camera Backpacks 1. MESSENGER BAG: THE IDEAL COMPANION FOR DAY TRIPS For day trips or outings, a messenger-style bag is the perfect companion. It offers quick and easy access to your camera, lenses, and essential accessories, all while you're on the move. With a capacity of ten to fifteen litres, it can comfortably hold all your necessities, from spare batteries to a water bottle, allowing you to focus on capturing the perfect shot without the hassle of setting the bag down. 2. SMALL BACKPACK: VERSATILE FOR ONE-DAY PHOTOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS For one-day photography outings or workshops, a small backpack with a capacity between twelve and twenty litres is an excellent choice. These bags can accommodate a camera body, typically two lenses, filters, two spare batteries, a tripod, and a variety of smaller accessories while providing space for additional clothing layers and snacks. When you'll be out for extended periods ranging from three to eight hours, a comfortable backpack that can be worn while hiking or trekking up and down hills is essential. 3. LARGER BACKPACK: IDEAL FOR MULTI-DAY PHOTOGRAPHY ADVENTURES For multi-day events or workshops, a giant backpack with a capacity between twenty and thirty litres becomes necessary. In addition to the gear required for one-day outings, such as a camera body, lenses, filters, chargers, and clothing layers, these backpacks offer ample space for additional lenses and accessories. Comfort and overall weight distribution are crucial considerations when selecting a larger backpack, as you'll likely be carrying it for extended periods while walking or trekking.In this article, I compare these three camera bags of different sizes and styles and share my verdict. Manfrotto and Lowepro kindly provided me with these bags to review, and whilst I haven’t tested them all in the field individually, I have sufficient experience to know how they feel when loaded, which I did, and how they would be utilised when using them.FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A CAMERA BAGBefore we dive into the specifics of each camera bag, let's discuss the key features to consider when selecting the perfect photography companion: 1. Capacity and Compartments: The camera bag should have ample space to accommodate your camera body, lenses, and other essential accessories. Dedicated compartments and dividers help keep your gear organised and secure. 2. Protection: Your camera equipment is an investment worth protecting. Look for camera bags with padded interiors, water-resistant materials, and robust construction to safeguard your gear from bumps, drops, and inclement weather. 3. Comfort and Ergonomics: As a photographer, you'll often find yourself on the move, carrying your camera bag for extended periods. Padded shoulder straps, back panels, and adjustable hip belts can significantly improve comfort and distribute weight evenly. 4. Accessibility: Quick access to your camera and lenses is essential for capturing fleeting moments. Look for backpacks with side or top openings, which allow you to retrieve your gear without having to remove the entire pack. 5. Additional Features: Extras like tripod holders, rain covers, and laptop compartments can enhance the backpack's functionality and versatility.------------------ ents.

While cameras and lenses are essential tools, a reliable and functional camera bag is equally crucial. In this article, we will delve into the world of messenger camera bags, specifically comparing two popular options: the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III and the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II.Messenger camera bags have become a popular choice among photographers due to their versatility and convenience. These bags are designed to carry camera equipment while providing easy access, making them ideal for on-the-go shooting. With their sleek and stylish appearance, messenger bags blend seamlessly into urban environments, allowing photographers to move freely without drawing unnecessary attention.COMPARISON - MANFROTTO ADVANCED MESSENGER CAMERA BAG M III VERSUS LOWEPRO PROTACTIC MG 160 AW IILowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIKey Features:Design: Messenger style. Tactical, rugged design with modular accessories.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Top access for quick camera retrieval, side and front pockets for additional storageMaterials: Durable. Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover built into base of bagAdditional Features: SlipLock compatible attachment loops for additional pouches and accessories plus small laptop spaceCapacity: 14LCamera Gear: DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lenses, and a flash.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. External side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £95Weight: 1.4kgDimensions:Internal: 37 x 14 x 25.5 cmExternal: 40 x 17 x 28 cmPros:* Highly durable and robust, suitable for demanding environments.* Excellent weather protection with AW Cover.* Modular design allows for customisation with additional pouches and accessories.Cons:* Heavier and bulkier than some other camera bags.* Tactical design may not be as versatile for all settings.My Verdict: 8/10It certainly meets my criteria for a short trip out with the camera, and with a couple of lenses and the little extras I need to stuff away somewhere outside of my clothing pockets. The front opening flap is a little annoying but does provide protection when the top of the bag is exposed to the elements. The flexible dividers in the bag are useful but slightly flimsy. But for me, the absence of quick access from the top to the camera inside the bag without opening the main bag flap is an irritant.More Information / Buy View fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIView fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIView fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIView fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIKey Features:Design: Sleek, modern messenger bag design with a comfortable shoulder strap.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Quick access to top zipper and multiple external pockets for accessories.Materials: Durable.Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover - separa :Design: Sleek, modern messenger bag design with a comfortable shoulder strap.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Quick access to top zipper and multiple external pockets for accessories.Materials: Durable.Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover - separate item (not built in) Additional Features: Dedicated padded compartment for a tablet or small laptop or other accessoriesCapacity: 16LCamera Gear: DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lenses, and a flash.Personal Items: Space for small personal items.

Comfortable strapping and quick easy access with the top opening make it more practical for the travelling photographer or day-tripper. The inner divider sections are stiff making it easy to divide up the internal space to suit your gear. Even though both comparison bags are similar in dimensions, the Manfrotto Messenger bag feels naturally more roomy and easier.More Information / Buy View fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIView fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIView fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIView fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIICOMPARISON SUMMARY: * Capacity: Both bags offer similar capacities for camera gear, though the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III may accommodate slightly more personal items. * Design: The Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III features a sleek, modern design ideal for everyday use, while the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II has a rugged, tactical look suitable for more demanding conditions. * Protection: The Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II offers superior weather protection with its All Weather AW Cover, whereas the Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III focuses more on internal padding and water-repellent fabric. * Access: Both bags provide quick access to camera gear, but the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II offers additional modularity and external storage options. * Additional Features: The Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II's modular design and SlipLock system offer greater customisation for users needing to expand their carrying capacity.Overall, the choice between these two bags will depend on the user's specific needs: the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III is great for everyday use with a sleek design, while the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II is better suited for more rugged and customisable requirements.----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION TO SMALL CAMERA BACKPACKSAs a passionate photographer, having the right gear is crucial for capturing those breathtaking moments. One essential piece of equipment that often gets overlooked is the camera backpack.

We'll compare their features, pros, and cons, helping you determine which one best suits your photography needs and lifestyle.COMPARISON - LOWEPRO TREKKER LITE BP 150 AW, BLACK VERSUS MANFROTTO STREET CAMERA SLIM BACKPACKLowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, BlackKey Features:Design: Lightweight and versatile backpack.Protection: All Weather AW Cover for protection against the elements.Access: Rear and side access to gear, multiple compartments.Materials: Durable, eco-friendly fabric made from recycled materials.Additional Features: CradleFit compartment for a 15-inch laptop or tablet, adjustable dividers.Capacity: 18.5LCamera Gear: Mirrorless camera with attached small lens and accessories.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. Some clothing and external side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £99Weight: 0.9kgDimensions:Internal: 26 x 11 x 44 cmExternal: 26 x 15 x 45 cmPros:* Excellent protection with the All Weather AW Cover, ensuring gear is safe in various weather conditions.* Made from durable, eco-friendly fabric produced from recycled materials.* Comfortable padding on straps for shoulders and your backCons:* Bulkier Design: Slightly bulkier compared to slim profile backpacks, which may not be ideal for all settings.* The camera compartment is very small and only suited to the mirrorless camera body with one small lens attached* Lacks configurable dividers for camera section in the bagMy Verdict:6/10Despite having a larger overall capacity over the similar external dimensions of the Manfrotto I couldn't configure it satisfactorily to accommodate the same amount of camera gear, accessories and clothing items as quickly as the Manfrotto Street Slimpack. I do like the ability to take the camera cube out from the bag and use as a shoulder bag independantly but feel it suits much smaller camera bodies and smaller lenses than my own requirements. The padding and comfort is better than the Manfrotto equivalent.More Information / Buy View fullsizeLowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, BlackView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------View fullsizeManfrotto Street Slim Camera BackpackKey Features:Design: Slim, stylish, and compact, making it ideal for urban environments and lighter loads.Protection: Padded compartments for camera gear.Access: Front and top access to gear, quick-access pockets.Materials: Durable, water-repellent fabric.Additional Features: Dedicated compartment for a 14-inch laptop, adjustable dividersCapacity: 15LCamera Gear: Mirrorless or compact DSLR camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lensesPersonal Items: Space for small personal items.

MASTER LIGHTING, STYLING AND SHARPNESS — IN MINUTES, NOT MONTHS.Still life is the most controllable genre — ideal for learning precise lighting, clean composition and tack-sharp focus. This guide shows simple set-ups with window light or one light, how to stage objects and backgrounds, and the exposure choices that make textures pop without glare.3 key takeaways * Light control: Use soft window light or a softbox at ~45°; add a white bounce to lift shadows and a black flag to deepen contrast. Diffuse shiny subjects; avoid mixed white balance. * Composition & styling: Rule of odds, colour harmony, negative space and leading lines. Vary heights, layer textures, watch edge clean-up, and remove distractions to tell a clear story. * Sharpness & exposure: Tripod, base ISO, f/8–f/11, single-point AF or manual focus with magnification. Use a remote/timer, check the histogram to avoid clipping, and bracket when reflective.Table of Contents ShowINTRODUCTION - WHAT IS STILL LIFE PHOTOGRAPHY?Still life photography captivates with its ability to transform everyday objects into extraordinary works of art. This genre allows photographers to exercise complete control over composition, lighting, and mood, making it a powerful medium for artistic expression and visual storytelling. Through careful arrangement and creative still life photography techniques, eryday objects into extraordinary works of art. This genre allows photographers to exercise complete control over composition, lighting, and mood, making it a powerful medium for artistic expression and visual storytelling. Through careful arrangement and creative still life photography techniques, still life images can convey deep emotions, cultural significance, and complex narratives.In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the essential elements of still life photography. Readers will discover the art of lighting to create atmosphere and depth, learn techniques for styling and arranging compelling scenes, and gain insights into post-processing methods to enhance their images. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the definition of still-life photography or an experienced photographer aiming to refine your skills, this article offers valuable knowledge to elevate your creative practice and produce captivating still-life photo compositions.Simple soft light + clean styling = pro-looking still life at home.THE ART OF LIGHTING IN STILL LIFE PHOTOGRAPHYLighting plays a crucial role in studio still life photography, shaping the mood, atmosphere, and visual impact of the image. Photographers have the opportunity to exercise complete control over the illumination of their subjects, creating captivating compositions that draw the viewer's eye to specific elements within the frame.NATURAL LIGHT TECHNIQUESNatural light is often the preferred choice for simple still life photography, especially for beginners. It offers a colour temperature that appears natural to the human eye and can be easily managed through diffusion and bouncing techniques. To harness natural light effectively, photographers should position their subjects near a window, allowing the soft, directional light to illuminate the scene. This approach can create a Vermeer-style window light effect, reminiscent of classic still life photography black and white paintings.To control natural light, photographers can use simple tools such as white fabric to cover the window, diffusing harsh sunlight and creating a softer, more even illumination. Reflectors or bounce cards can be employed to fill in shadows and add depth to the still image. For those seeking a moodier atmosphere, black cards or flags can be used to block light and deepen shadows, creating a chiaroscuro effect reminiscent of Renaissance still shots.ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING SETUPSWhen natural light is unavailable or insufficient, artificial lighting becomes essential. Studio setup flashes, continuous LED lights , or even household lamps can be used to create compelling photography still life images. Artificial lighting offers greater control over the direction, intensity, and colour of light, allowing photographers to achieve specific effects regardless of the time of day or weather conditions.A basic artificial lighting setup might include: 1. A main light source (key light) positioned to the side and slightly above the subject 2. A fill light or reflector to soften shadows 3. A rim light to create highlights and separate the subject from the backgroundFor more advanced setups, photographers can experiment with gridded soft boxes, honeycomb grids, and barn doors to shape and direct light precisely. These tools help to control spill and create dramatic fall-offs, isolating the subject and enhancing the overall mood of the still images.CREATING MOOD WITH advanced setups, photographers can experiment with gridded soft boxes, honeycomb grids, and barn doors to shape and direct light precisely. These tools help to control spill and create dramatic fall-offs, isolating the subject and enhancing the overall mood of the still images.CREATING MOOD WITH LIGHTThe way light is manipulated in modern still life photography has a direct impact on the mood and tone of the final image. Soft, diffused light can create a bright and airy atmosphere, perfect for summery or fresh compositions like fruit still life photography. Conversely, hard light with deep shadows can evoke a sense of drama and mystery.Backlighting is an effective technique for creating interest and depth in still life images. By positioning the light source behind the subject, photographers can generate attractive highlights and create a bright background without shadows. This approach works particularly well for translucent subjects like glassware or certain types of fruit.Photographers can underexpose their images slightly to achieve a moody, atmospheric look, bringing out contrast and depth. This technique, combined with careful light control using colour gels, modelling light, and atmospheric effects, can transform everyday objects into extraordinary works of art, capturing the essence of still life photography's rich artistic heritage.QUICK TIPS — STILL LIFE * Keep it simple: choose one hero object and 1–3 supporting props that serve the story. * Light at 45°–90°: soft side/back light; add a white bounce for fill and a black flag to deepen edge contrast. * Matte backgrounds: neutral paper/linen/board to avoid glare and colour casts. * Tripod + base ISO: shoot at f/8–f/11; use a 2-sec timer/remote to keep detail crisp. * Edge discipline: avoid mergers and tight edges; leave breathing room and use negative space. * Control reflections: diffuse shiny items, angle the subject/light, or add a CPL for speculars. * Consistent colour: set Kelvin/custom white balance and keep it the same across the set. * Inspect at 100%: dust, fingerprints, crooked labels—fix on set to save time later.STYLING AND ARRANGING STILL LIFE SCENESCHOOSING COMPLEMENTARY OBJECTSThe art of tabletop photography begins with selecting objects that have a relationship or theme. Photographers often choose recognisable household items or goods, combining them in ways that establish unity or create interesting comparisons. This approach contributes to visual storytelling and enhances the overall composition. When selecting objects, it's crucial to consider a variety of textures. For instance, pairing smooth glass vases with bumpy citrus fruits creates an intriguing contrast, adding depth of field and interest to the image.CREATING BALANCE AND HARMONYTo achieve a balanced composition, photographers should arrange objects of varying heights. This technique helps guide the viewer's eye through the photo, allowing for emphasis on different elements and creating a more engaging overall composition. One effective approach is to use a mixture of small and large objects or create different levels of platforms the rest of the items upon. Additionally, symmetry plays a vital role in still-life compositions. Photographers can incorporate symmetrical balance by distributing equal visual weight on both sides of a central axis, or opt for asymmetrical balance by usin cts or create different levels of platforms the rest of the items upon. Additionally, symmetry plays a vital role in still-life compositions. Photographers can incorporate symmetrical balance by distributing equal visual weight on both sides of a central axis, or opt for asymmetrical balance by using different elements to create equilibrium.USING COLOUR THEORYColour harmony is essential for creating visually appealing still-life photos. Understanding basic colour theory principles can help photographers evoke specific emotions and create contrasting effects. Complementary colours, opposite each other on the colour wheel (e.g., red and green), can create strong contrast and visual interest. Analogous colours adjacent to the colour wheel (e.g., red, orange, and yellow) create a sense of harmony and unity. Triadic colours, evenly spaced around the colour wheel (e.g., red, blue, and yellow), can produce a vibrant and dynamic effect. Photographers can enhance the overall impact of their still-life compositions by carefully selecting and arranging objects based on these colour-balance relationships.View fullsizeGRAB THE 1-PAGE STILL LIFE CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 guide with setup, lighting, styling, do/don’t, quick drills and editing tips.Download Still Life Checklist (PDF) 1-to-1 Zoom Help Book the Composition Clinic (£29) Prefer a text link? Download the Still Life Checklist (PDF) POST-PROCESSING STILL LIFE IMAGESPost-production plays a crucial role in elevating still life photographs from good to captivating. It allows photographers to infuse creativity and fine-tuned control into their images. Mastery over tools like Photoshop editing and Lightroom helps breathe life into still life compositions, enhancing their inherent qualities without overshadowing the subject's natural allure.BASIC ADJUSTMENTSThe editing journey often begins with essential adjustments. Photographers typically start by tweaking exposure settings, which is vital for achieving the desired mood. Contrast adjustment is tactfully increased to accentuate the subject, while white balance is set to align the image's temperature with the artistic vision. These fundamental edits lay the groundwork for more advanced techniques.ADVANCED EDITING TECHNIQUESAs photographers become more experienced, they can explore advanced options to further enhance their still life images. Focus stacking in Photoshop ensures every detail is razor-sharp, a critical aspect of still life photography. Colour grading, though subtle, can significantly impact the overall feel of the image. Some photographers apply textures in Photoshop to add depth or imbue character into the photograph.CREATING A COHESIVE STYLEDeveloping a consistent editing style is key to creating a cohesive body of work. This involves finding the right balance in post-processi t the overall feel of the image. Some photographers apply textures in Photoshop to add depth or imbue character into the photograph.CREATING A COHESIVE STYLEDeveloping a consistent editing style is key to creating a cohesive body of work. This involves finding the right balance in post-processing, favouring natural enhancements that complement the scene rather than overpowering it. Micro-adjustments to various facets of the image, such as refining sharpness and fine-tuning textures, contribute to the professional quality of still life photographs.By mastering these post-processing techniques, photographers can transform their still life images, ensuring that every nuance contributes to the overall perfection of the composition.EDITING TIPS — STILL LIFE * Lock WB first: set a neutral white balance on one image, then sync to the whole series. * Global tone: set white/black points, then add mid-tone contrast with a gentle S-curve. * Local shaping: dodge highlights and burn shadow edges to add depth and guide the eye. * Texture control: add clarity/texture to the hero; soften busy props in the background. * Colour hygiene: use HSL to tame casts (reds/yellows in wood/food) and keep palette consistent. * Cleanup pass: heal dust/crumbs; straighten labels; fix tiny alignment issues. * Sharpen smart: apply capture sharpening lightly; export sharpening for web/print separately. * Consistent output: sRGB, matching crops/aspect ratios, and sensible filenames for the set.EXAMPLES OF STILL LIFE PHOTOGRAPHYAt this point, I will redirect you to two of my clients, better than me on this subject execution, whom I mentored over a long period to produce a body of work on still lifes- they were projects to achieve the RPS Associates qualification and a perfect showcase of the topic being executed well----------------------------------------Jacki Rosin ARPS - Still Life FlowersView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsiz",

It not only deeply influences the exposure of an image but also adds a significant aesthetic dimension to the visual narrative. The aperture, an integral part of the camera's lens, dictates the speed of collecting amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor, hence impacting the overall sharpness and depth of an image. This essential guide is designed to demystify the concept of aperture, explain its pivotal role in photography, and illustrate how mastering it can elevate one's photographic endeavors from ordinary to extraordinary.As we delve deeper into this exploration, we will uncover not just \"what does aperture mean in photography\" but also understand its tangible effect ture, explain its pivotal role in photography, and illustrate how mastering it can elevate one's photographic endeavors from ordinary to extraordinary.As we delve deeper into this exploration, we will uncover not just \"what does aperture mean in photography\" but also understand its tangible effect on exposure and depth of field. Moreover, selecting appropriate camera aperture settings is crucial for achieving the desired artistic and technical outcome in one's photographs. This article promises to offer a beginners \"aperture guide,\" covering the essentials of \"aperture meaning photography,\" its impact on image composition, and practical tips for harnessing this knowledge in field scenarios. Whether you're deciphering \"what is aperture photography\" for the first time or seeking to refine your understanding of aperture, this guide stands as a beacon for beginners eager to explore the vast, dynamic landscape of photography.DEMYSTIFYING APERTURE - WHAT IS APERTUREINTRODUCTION TO CONCEPT - WHAT IS APERTUREAperture definition photography: Aperture can be defined as the opening in a lens through which light passes to enter the aperture camera. This crucial setting controls the amount or speed of light reaching the camera's sensor, directly influencing the exposure time of the resulting aperture photos. Additionally, aperture affects the depth of field, which determines the range of sharpness within a photo. Large aperture photography (indicated by a smaller f-number) results in a shallower depth of field, focusing attention on the subject while blurring the background. Conversely, small aperture photography (larger f-number) enhances the depth of field, keeping more of the scene in focus.WHAT IS APERTURE AND HOW DOES IT WORK?QUICK TIPS — WHAT IS APERTURE? * Aperture is the opening in a lens that controls how much light enters the camera. * It is measured in f-stops (e.g. f/2.8, f/8, f/16) — smaller numbers = larger opening. * Aperture also controls depth of field (how much of the scene is in focus). * The f-number is calculated as: focal length ÷ aperture diameter.Aperture is like a doorway for light in your camera lens—it controls how much light reaches the camera sensor. But here’s something important to understand: the distance light travels also affects how bright it is when it gets there. This is explained by something called the Inverse Square Law.Think of it this way: if you're sitting close to a campfire, the light is bright and warm. But if you step further away, the firelight gets dimmer because it has to travel farther to reach you. The same happens inside a camera lens—light loses strength as it travels over distance.Now, imagine two lenses: * A 50mm lens with an aperture diameter of 10mm equals f/5. * A 100mm lens with an aperture diameter of 20mm also equals f/5.Even though the 100mm lens has a larger aperture opening, the light has to travel twice as far as in the 50mm lens. This is why both lenses let in the same amount of light when set to f/5—the f-number adjusts for the distance the light travels.But aperture doesn’t just control light—it also affects how much of your scene is in focus, or what photographers call the depth of field. Depth of field is the area in front of and behind your subject that appears sharp in the photo.The f-number is just a simple ratio:f-number = focal length ÷ aperture sizeWHAT “F-STOPS” REALLY MEANTechnically: The f-number (N) is a ratio: f-number = f photographers call the depth of field. Depth of field is the area in front of and behind your subject that appears sharp in the photo.The f-number is just a simple ratio:f-number = focal length ÷ aperture sizeWHAT “F-STOPS” REALLY MEANTechnically: The f-number (N) is a ratio: f-number = focal length ÷ entrance-pupil diameter. Higher f-numbers mean a smaller opening; lower f-numbers mean a wider opening. Each full “stop” changes the light-collection rate by 2× (…f/2 → f/2.8 → f/4 → f/5.6 → f/8 → f/11 → f/16…).Why “stops”? A stop is a doubling/halving step. One stop smaller aperture needs 2× the time (or ISO) to keep the same exposure; one stop wider needs ½ the time. That’s why shutter speed and ISO “trade” with aperture to keep the meter reading.Beginner memory trick: “F = what’s in Focus”F/4 ≈ 4 things in focus into the distance (shallow).F/16 ≈ 16 things in focus (deep).It’s a mnemonic (not a literal count) that matches reality: bigger f-numbers → more depth of field.F-stop Aperture size Collection speed* Depth of field Use case f/2.8 Wide Fast (short shutter) Shallow background Portraits, low light f/5.6–f/8 Medium Balanced Moderate Street/travel f/11–f/16 Narrow Slow (longer shutter) Deep Landscapes/architecture*Collection speed = how quickly the sensor gathers the metered amount of light. Scene light stays the same; aperture only changes the rate. * More blur? Use a smaller f-number and shorten shutter to keep exposure. * More in focus? Use a larger f-number and lengthen shutter (or raise ISO) to keep the meter happy.HOW FOCAL LENGTH AFFECTS DEPTH OF FIELDAt the same aperture (like f/5), a longer focal length, like a 100mm lens, will have a much shallower depth of field compared to a shorter focal length, like a 50mm lens.For example: * With a 50mm lens at f/5, more of the scene in front of and behind your subject will appear sharp, making it great for capturing environments or groups where you want everything in focus. * With a 100mm lens at f/5, the depth of field becomes much narrower, so the background will blur out more, isolating your subject. This is perfect for portraits or scenes where you want a dreamy, out-of-focus background (also known as bokeh).This happens because the longer focal length magnifies the subject and compresses the background, reducing the range of focus.QUICK TIPS — HOW APERTURE AFFECTS PHOTOS * Wide aperture (f/1.8–f/4): Fast light collection, requires shorter shutter times, produces shallow depth of field with blurred backgrounds — great for portraits. * Narrow aperture (f/11–f/22): Slow light collection, requires longer shutter times, produces deep depth of field with more of the scene sharp — great for landscapes. * At the same f-stop, longer focal lengths (e.g. 100mm) create shallower depth of field than shorter focal lengths (e.g. 50mm).PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHERUnderstanding how aperture, focal length, and depth of field work together gives you more creative control. If you want to highlight your subject with a beautifully blurred background, a longer focal length like 100mm at f/5 is a great choice. But if you want more of the scene to stay sharp, a shorter focal length like 50mm at the same aperture will give you that result.By experimenting with different lenses and apertures, you can create the exact look you want in your photos!HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDThe journey of understanding and utilising aperture in photography has evolved significant ter focal length like 50mm at the same aperture will give you that result.By experimenting with different lenses and apertures, you can create the exact look you want in your photos!HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDThe journey of understanding and utilising aperture in photography has evolved significantly over the centuries. Early experiments by Arabian scientist Abu Ali Hasan in the 10th century marked the beginning of optical exploration. Hasan's rudimentary studies with a glass sphere laid the groundwork for future advancements in lens technology. By the 1500s, it was discovered that incorporating an aperture improved the image quality by reducing optical aberrations, although the scientific underpinnings of this phenomenon were not yet understood.The significant leap in aperture technology came with the invention of the camera obscura and further refinements by Charles Chevalier, who introduced lenses with fixed apertures. The real transformation occurred in 1858 when John Waterhouse introduced selectable aperture sizes using his Waterhouse stops, revolutionising photographic flexibility and control. This innovation allowed photographers to adjust the aperture size to alter the depth of field and exposure, enhancing artistic expression in photography.By the 1880s, the correlation between aperture size and depth of field became widely recognised, leading to the development of the iris diaphragm in lenses, a precursor to the modern aperture control mechanisms. This understanding allowed photographers to manipulate focus and exposure with greater precision, contributing to the artistry and technical proficiency in photographic practices.APERTURE REFERENCE TABLEf-stop Opening Size Light Collection Rate Depth of Field Typical Use f/1.8 – f/4 Wide Fast (short shutter needed) Shallow Portraits, low-light scenes f/5.6 – f/8 Medium Balanced (general-purpose) Moderate Street, travel, everyday f/11 – f/22 Narrow Slow (longer shutter needed) Deep Landscapes, architectureAPERTURE'S INFLUENCE ON EXPOSURE - WHAT IS APERTUREBEGINNER TIP — THE LIGHT IS ALWAYS THE SAMEExposure isn’t about capturing “more” or “less” light – the camera always needs the same total amount for a correct exposure (as measured by the light meter). What changes is the speed of collecting that light: * Aperture: Think of the lens as a tap valve – wide open collects faster, narrow collects slowly. * Shutter speed: How long the tap is left running – short vs long collection time. * ISO: How sensitive the bucket is – higher ISO = faster fill, but noisier water.Analogy: Imagine needing exactly 1 litre of water in a bucket. You can fill it quickly with the tap fully open, or slowly drip by drip with the tap nearly closed. Either way, you still end up with exactly 1 litre — just collected at different speeds.Aperture photography meaning: Aperture, a fundamental aspect of photography, plays a crucial role in determining the exposure of an image. The size of the aperture, measured in f-stops, directly impacts the amount of light that can enter the aperture on the camera, thus influencing the speed of exposure time of the photograph.EXPLANATION OF F-STOPSF-stops, or f-numbers, are a way to describe the size of the aperture opening in a lens. The f-stop scale is an inverse relationship where a smaller f-stop number like f/2.8 denotes a larger aperture, allowing light to hit the camera sensor quickly. Converse the photograph.EXPLANATION OF F-STOPSF-stops, or f-numbers, are a way to describe the size of the aperture opening in a lens. The f-stop scale is an inverse relationship where a smaller f-stop number like f/2.8 denotes a larger aperture, allowing light to hit the camera sensor quickly. Conversely, a larger f-stop number, such as f/16, indicates a smaller aperture, reducing the speed of the required light. This scale is crucial for photographers to understand as it allows them to manipulate light intake based on the desired visual effect and lighting conditions.QUICK TIPS — UNDERSTANDING F-STOPSF-stops control how wide the aperture opens in your lens. Each “stop” is a step that halves or doubles the rate of light collected. Smaller numbers (f/1.4, f/2) mean a wider opening, faster collection, and shallow depth of field. Larger numbers (f/16, f/22) mean a narrow opening, slower collection, and deeper depth of field. * Wide aperture (f/1.4–f/4): Fast light collection, blurred backgrounds → great for portraits & low light. * Mid aperture (f/5.6–f/8): Balanced light & focus → ideal for everyday shooting. * Narrow aperture (f/11–f/32): Slow light collection, sharp front-to-back focus → perfect for landscapes.📌 Remember: each full stop change halves or doubles the collection rate. Use small f-numbers for blur and speed, large f-numbers for sharpness and control.✓ DO * Pick f-stops for intent: portraits f/1.8–f/2.8; groups f/5.6–f/8; landscapes f/8–f/11 (lens “sweet spot”). * Balance the triangle: changing f-stop alters collection speed—adjust shutter/ISO to keep the metered exposure. * Control depth of field: use longer focal lengths/closer subject for more blur; use hyperfocal distance for front-to-back sharpness.✗ DON’T * Don’t stop down “for brightness”: use shutter/ISO for exposure; aperture is for DoF and collection rate. * Don’t chase f/22–f/32 by default: diffraction can soften detail—only use very small apertures when necessary. * Don’t ignore shutter side-effects: a smaller aperture may force slow speeds → use tripod/IBIS or raise ISO.ADJUSTING EXPOSURE LEVELSAdjusting the aperture affects not only the speed of light capture but also how the camera captures the image. In low-light conditions, a photographer might choose a larger aperture (smaller f-stop number) to capture light faster, making the image sharper. This adjustment is similar to how our eyes widen under dim lighting to see better. On the other hand, in very bright conditions, a smaller aperture (larger f-stop number) can be used to limit the speed of light entering the camera, preventing overexposure.The choice of aperture also dictates other camera settings, such as shutter speed and ISO . A larger aperture (smaller f-stop) will generally require a faster shutter speed to avoid overexposure, whereas a smaller aperture (larger f-stop) might need a slower shutter speed to capture enough light, affecting how motion is captured in the image.Understanding and manipulating aperture settings allows photographers to achieve the correct exposure for their images, balancing the amount of light with the desired depth of field and sharpness. This control is essential for creating well-exposed photographs that align with the photographer's artistic vision.DEPTH OF FIELD AND APERTURE - WHAT IS APERTUREHOW APERTURE AFFECTS DEPTH OF FIELDAperture plays a pivotal",

You’ll learn how to control light with ND filters, lock in sharpness with solid technique, and choose the right shutter speed to shape motion in water, clouds and night scenes.3 key takeaways * Control light: choose the right ND filter and expose with histogram, not hope. * Stay sharp: tripod + remote/2s timer, IBIS off on tripod, precise focus on a static edge. * Design the motion: pick shutter speeds that suit the scene—silky water, streaked clouds or clean light trails.Table of Contents ShowINTRODUCTION - HOW TO TAKE LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOSLong exposure photography captures the essence of movement by allowing the camera's sensor to absorb light over an extended period. This technique transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, creating a realm where time stands still while the world around us is in constant flux.In this guide, we will explore how to take long exposure photos, mastering its techniques and unleashing your artistic vision. Whether you're a seasoned photographer or a curious beginner, this article will be your trusted companion on an enlightening journey.ROADMAP — FROM SETUP TO SHOT (LONG EXPOSURE) 1. Plan the frame: pick a static anchor (rock, pier, skyline) and decide the feel—calm & silky or energetic streaks. 2. Assemble gear: tripod hotographer or a curious beginner, this article will be your trusted companion on an enlightening journey.ROADMAP — FROM SETUP TO SHOT (LONG EXPOSURE) 1. Plan the frame: pick a static anchor (rock, pier, skyline) and decide the feel—calm & silky or energetic streaks. 2. Assemble gear: tripod, remote/2s timer, ND filters (3–10 stop), spare batteries, cloth for spray; turn off IBIS on tripod. 3. Base exposure test: Manual or Av • f/8–f/16 • ISO 64/100. Make a sharp, well-exposed test without ND. 4. Calculate with ND: choose ND strength to hit your target time (e.g., 1/15s → 30s with 10-stop). Use an app or table. 5. Focus & lock: focus on a static edge, switch to MF, add ND, cover the viewfinder (DSLR) to prevent light leaks. 6. Shoot clean: Bulb for >30s; trigger via remote. Keep hands off the setup; watch wind and tripod stability. 7. Review & refine: check histogram (protect highlights), inspect edges for blur, then nudge shutter/ND/angle as needed. 8. Create the look: vary time for mood—10–30s (texture), 30–120s (silky), 2–5min (ethereal). Try light trails, cloud streaks or minimalist water. 9. Edit with restraint: blend if needed; reduce noise gently; dodge/burn to guide the eye; avoid halos on hard edges. 10. Safety & etiquette: watch tides, waves and traffic; keep gear dry; be considerate at busy viewpoints.THE ESSENCE OF LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — ESSENCE * Use a long shutter to reveal motion the eye can’t—water, clouds, light. * Anchor the frame with something static so motion has a clear contrast. * Decide the “feel” first: calm (longer times) vs energy (shorter, streaked motion).At its core, long exposure photography prolongs the camera’s shutter speed to capture an extended period, revealing the unseen and transforming the fleeting into the enduring. It unveils the grace and beauty of movements that often evade the naked eye, such as waves crashing against the shore or the celestial choreography of clouds. Long-exposure photography invites viewers to immerse themselves in a realm where time is fluid, and the ordinary becomes extraordinary.WHEN TO EMBRACE LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — WHEN TO USE IT * Seascapes & rivers: smooth water for serenity; include a fixed object. * Skies & clouds: add direction and scale; watch wind for streak angle. * Cities at night: light trails and ghosted figures for still vs motion contrast.While long exposure photography is versatile, certain scenarios are particularly well-suited for this technique. Landscape and seascape imagery offer opportunities to capture mesmerising motion blurs with flowing water, drifting clouds, and swaying foliage. Urban environments provide a surreal juxtaposition between the static and the dynamic with light trails and ghostly figures. Long exposure can also breathe new life into mundane subjects like waterfalls, rivers, and the night sky, revealing their otherworldly beauty.View fullsizeESSENTIAL GEAR FOR LONG EXPOSURE ARTISTRYQUICK TIPS — GEAR * Tripod first: rock-solid, on firm ground; weight the centre column. * Remote or 2-sec timer to avoid touch-shake; mirror lock-up on DSLRs. * ND filters: 3–10 stops to control light; use a calculator/app for timing. * Robust body + lens: long exposures magnify tiny vibrations.While the concept of long exposure photography may seem straightforward, executing it flawlessly requires a specific set of gear. Each piece of ck-up on DSLRs. * ND filters: 3–10 stops to control light; use a calculator/app for timing. * Robust body + lens: long exposures magnify tiny vibrations.While the concept of long exposure photography may seem straightforward, executing it flawlessly requires a specific set of gear. Each piece of equipment plays a crucial role in ensuring that your images are sharp, well-exposed, and free from unwanted artifacts.A STURDY TRIPODThe foundation of any successful long exposure setup is a sturdy tripod. As the camera's shutter remains open for an extended period, even the slightest movement can result in blurred or distorted images. A robust tripod , coupled with a stable surface, ensures that your camera remains motionless throughout the exposure, preserving the sharpness and integrity of your final image.https://tidd.ly/4bHZz5oA REMOTE SHUTTER RELEASEEven the simple act of pressing the shutter button can introduce unwanted camera shake, compromising the clarity of your long exposure shots. To circumvent this issue, a remote shutter release is an indispensable accessory. By triggering the shutter from a distance, you eliminate the risk of camera movement, ensuring tack-sharp results every time.https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/alanrangerphotography?ref=cm_sw_em_r_inf_own_alanrangerphotography_dp_DnoX1mmDm34LWA Remote Shutter ReleaseNEUTRAL DENSITY (ND) FILTERSIn the realm of long exposure photography, neutral density (ND) filters are akin to sunglasses for your camera's lens. These specialised filters reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing you to extend the shutter speed without overexposing the image. ND filters come in various strengths, ranging from 3-stop to 10-stop or even higher, providing you with the flexibility to capture a wide range of long exposure effects.https://kasefilters.com/ref/alan.ranger/A STURDY CAMERA BODY AND LENSWhile any modern camera can be used for long-exposure photography, it's advisable to invest in a sturdy camera body and lens combination. The extended exposure times can magnify even the slightest vibrations, potentially compromising the sharpness of your images. Opting for a robust setup will ensure that your gear can withstand the rigors of long-exposure shooting, delivering consistently sharp and detailed results.MASTERING THE ART: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDEQUICK TIPS — ON-LOCATION SETUP * Scout & compose: plan the static anchor and where motion will read best. * Mount up: level tripod, attach remote; lock mirror if DSLR. * Base test: Manual or Aperture Priority; f/8–f/16, ISO 64/100. * Add ND: compute new shutter from the test frame; avoid clipping on histogram. * Need >30s? switch to Bulb; time the exposure with a remote/app. * Hands off during exposure; review histogram and refine time/ND strength.Now that you're equipped with the essential gear, it's time to delve into the intricacies of long-exposure photography. By following this step-by-step guide, you'll be well on your way to creating breathtaking images that capture the essence of movement and time.STEP 1: SCOUT AND COMPOSEThe first step in successful long exposure photography is scouting the location and composing the shot. Observe the scene, identify elements for the desired motion blur effect, and note the direction and speed of moving objects. Compose the shot carefully, considering stationary objects AND COMPOSEThe first step in successful long exposure photography is scouting the location and composing the shot. Observe the scene, identify elements for the desired motion blur effect, and note the direction and speed of moving objects. Compose the shot carefully, considering stationary objects and overall frame balance. Long exposure photography requires patience and attention to detail, so take your time to ensure the composition matches your vision.STEP 2: SET UP YOUR GEARWith your composition in place, it's time to set up your gear. Begin by mounting your camera securely on the tripod, ensuring that it's level and stable. Next, attach any necessary accessories, such as the remote shutter release and filter holder, if you plan to use drop-in filters.If you're using a digital SLR camera, it's recommended to engage the mirror lock-up function. This feature locks the camera's mirror in the up position, eliminating the risk of vibrations caused by the mirror's movement during the exposure.STEP 3: DIAL IN YOUR SETTINGSLong exposure photography requires precise control over camera settings.Method 1: Begin by setting the camera to manual mode to adjust aperture, shutter speed, and ISO independently.Select an aperture value between f/8 and f/16 for landscape shots to maintain depth of field.Set ISO to the lowest native value (ISO 100 or ISO 200) for better image quality.Take a test shot at a shutter speed recommended by the camera's light meter. Adjust the shutter speed based on the histogram until the desired result is achieved.Method 2: Set the exposure mode to Aperture Priority (A or AV). Select your aperture value to achieve the depth of field required and a low ISO (100 or 200) take a test shot and the camera will automatically set the shutter speed based on the metered calculation. Adjust the exposure using exposure compensation to deal with any under or exposed areas showing in the histogram and repeat the test shots until the exposure is perfect.STEP 4: INTRODUCE THE ND FILTERAttach the ND filter to the lens or filter holder . Use a filter calculator or app to determine the new shutter speed based on the filter's strength. For example, if the test shot required a shutter speed of 1/60th of a second and a 6-stop ND filter is used, the new shutter speed should be around 1-2 seconds. Read this How to Guide on Using ND Filters. If you are in Aperture Priority exposure mode the camera will adjust the shutter speed automatically all the way up to a maximum exposure time of 30 seconds. Beyond 30 seconds you will need to switch to manual exposure mode and use Bulb and calculate the exposure time manually in your head with an Apphttps://kasefilters.com/ref/alan.ranger/STEP 5: SWITCH TO BULB MODE IF REQUIRING LONGER THAN 30 SECOND EXPOSURE TIME (OPTIONAL)Engage Bulb mode and use a remote shutter release or cable release to open and close the shutter manually. This method provides you with complete control over the exposure duration, enabling you to capture ultra-long exposures spanning minutes or even hours.STEP 6: CAPTURE THE MOMENTWith your settings dialed in and your gear properly configured, it's time to capture the moment. Use your remote shutter release or cable release to trigger the exposure, and let the magic unfold.During the exposure, avoid touching or disturbing the camera, as any vibrations can introduce unwanted blur or d settings dialed in and your gear properly configured, it's time to capture the moment. Use your remote shutter release or cable release to trigger the exposure, and let the magic unfold.During the exposure, avoid touching or disturbing the camera, as any vibrations can introduce unwanted blur or distortion. If you're shooting in a public area, be mindful of your surroundings and take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of your equipment and those around you.STEP 7: REVIEW AND REFINEOnce the exposure is complete, review the image on your camera's LCD screen or histogram. Adjust shutter speed or ND filter strength if needed. Repeat until desired result is achieved. Long exposure photography requires patience and experimentation. Embrace the learning curve and refine skills with each experience.UNLEASHING CREATIVITY: TECHNIQUES AND IDEASQUICK TIPS — CREATIVE USES * Light trails: choose traffic flow or star paths; test angles for clean streaks. * Minimalism: off-peak locations; use long times to erase surface fuss. * Abstract motion: go longer to embrace blur in trees, dancers, crowds. * Combine: light painting, multiple exposures, ICM—experiment in sets.While the fundamentals of long exposure photography are relatively straightforward, the true artistry lies in your ability to think creatively and push the boundaries of what's possible. Here are some techniques and ideas to inspire your journey and help you unlock your creative potential.CAPTURING LIGHT TRAILSOne captivating application of long exposure photography is capturing light trails. Whether in an urban or rural setting, the streaks of light created by moving vehicles or celestial bodies can enhance images. To capture light trails, find locations with traffic or a clear view of the night sky. Set up your camera on a tripod and use a shutter speed of several seconds to several minutes for the desired effect. Experiment with angles and compositions for unique and visually striking light trail patterns.Capturing Light TrailsEMBRACING MINIMALISMLong exposure photography is a powerful tool for embracing minimalism in your imagery. Shoot in urban environments during off-peak hours or in remote natural settings to transform lack of movement into a serene, minimalistic scene. Experiment with long exposures to smooth out water surfaces, blur moving clouds, or create stillness in a bustling environment.EXPERIMENTING WITH MOTION BLURWhile long exposure photography can capture smooth motion blur, it can also be used to create dynamic, abstract images by embracing chaotic movement. Look for subjects with erratic or unpredictable motion patterns, like dancers, athletes, or swaying tree branches. Use longer shutter speeds to exaggerate motion blur and create visually striking compositions that challenge perception of time and movement.COMBINING TECHNIQUESOne of the joys of long exposure photography is combining techniques like light painting, multiple exposures, and intentional camera movement to create unique images. Experiment with different combinations and push the boundaries to transform the ordinary into extraordinary.POST-PROCESSING TECHNIQUES FOR LONG EXPOSURE ARTISTRYQUICK TIPS — EDITING * Blend exposures for high-contrast scenes to keep highlight detail. * Use noise reduction sparingly—preserve fine texture in static areas. * Dodge/burn selectively to guide the eye through static vs motion. * Grade colour to match mood; keep",

While understanding exposure, focus, and lighting is crucial, composition is the key to elevating images from snapshots to captivating visual stories. A photograph's composition influences how viewers experience and connect with the image, and it plays a vital role in creating emotional resonance.This guide on how to improve your photography composition draws from over 15 years of teaching experience and focuses on helping you enhance your compositions. By blending traditional rules with emotional and intellectual approaches, you can develop a more personal and intuitive style. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced photographer, these techniques will help you transform your images into powerful stories that communicate nce your compositions. By blending traditional rules with emotional and intellectual approaches, you can develop a more personal and intuitive style. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced photographer, these techniques will help you transform your images into powerful stories that communicate visually and emotionally.15 PRINCIPLES — COMPOSITION QUICK GUIDE * 1) Shoot What It Feels Like, Not Just What It Looks Like — decide the emotion first, then compose to serve it. * 2) Master the Rule of Thirds — place key subjects on intersections; keep horizons clean. * 3) Use Leading Lines to Guide the Eye — roads, edges, light paths; point them to your subject. * 4) Simplify Your Frame for Greater Impact — one idea; remove anything that doesn’t help. * 5) Balance Visual Weight — counter size with tone/colour/space; squint test for equilibrium. * 6) Utilise Negative Space — give the subject breathing room; let space set the mood. * 7) Watch Your Borders — clean edges, no mergers; reframe or crop to fix. * 8) Understand Depth and Dimension — build FG/MG/BG layers; use perspective and overlap. * 9) Capture Emotion, Not Just Visuals — gesture, timing, light quality → feeling. * 10) Use Colour Theory to Enhance Composition — complementary for pop, analogous for harmony; manage warm/cool balance. * 11) Master Juxtaposition — contrast scale, old/new, light/dark to create meaning. * 12) Harness Patterns and Repetition — establish rhythm; break the pattern for emphasis. * 13) Incorporate Movement and Flow — diagonals, implied motion; choose shutter to freeze or blur. * 14) Embrace Imperfection — purposeful blur, grain, off-centre choices that suit the story. * 15) Edit Your Photos Thoughtfully — crop for intent, unify tone/colour, keep restraint and consistency.Compose with intention: pick the feeling, choose the tools (thirds, lines, space, colour), clean the edges, and refine in edit—consistently.1. SHOOT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, NOT JUST WHAT IT LOOKS LIKEA technically perfect photograph may still feel flat if it lacks emotional depth or narrative. Focusing solely on technical elements such as sharpness and exposure often results in an image that is visually correct but emotionally void. Instead, aim to capture the essence of the moment—the feelings, atmosphere, or story behind the scene.Ask yourself: * Why am I drawn to this subject? * What emotions or narrative do I want to communicate? * How can I interpret this scene to best express what I feel?By contemplating these questions, you shift from simply documenting a scene to conveying a deeper story. Your photographs will carry more weight and emotional appeal.2. MASTER THE RULE OF THIRDSThe Rule of Thirds is a fundamental guideline that divides your frame into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. Placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections creates a balanced and engaging composition. This rule helps direct the viewer's eye through the frame and is a great starting point for composition. Once you're comfortable with this technique, don’t be afraid to break the rule deliberately. Experiment with off-centre compositions to add a dynamic twist to your photography.3. USE LEADING LINES TO GUIDE THE EYELeading lines are powerful tools in photography composition that guide the viewer’s gaze through an image. These lines can be natural , like rivers or coastlines, or man-made, such as roads or architectural elements. By positioning leading lines strategically, you can direct attention to the main subject and create a sense of depth and movement within your photographs. Leading lines are especially effective in landscape photography. Look for paths, rows of trees, or flowing water that naturally draw the eye toward the focal point of your image.4. SIMPLIFY YOUR FRAME FOR GREATER IMPACTA common mistake in photography is overcrowding the frame with too many elements. A cluttered image confuses the viewer and dilutes the focus on the main subject. Instead, strive for simplicity by eliminating distractions and honing in on what is essential.Techniques to simplify your frame include: * Getting closer to your subject * Changing your perspective * Using a shallow depth of field to isolate your subject from the backgroundMinimalism in photography emphasises the beauty of simplicity. Employing negative space, focusing on one subject, and using the Rule of Odds (favouring odd numbers of elements) can create a more substantial visual impact.5. BALANCE VISUAL WEIGHTBalance is about distributing visual elements across the frame in a harmonious way. Symmetry, achieved by mirroring elements on either side of the frame, creates a sense of stability and order. On the other hand, asymmetry, which uses contrasting sizes, shapes, or colours to balance a composition, adds dynamism and interest. Achieving balance is not limited to symmetry alone. Asymmetry can be just as effective when used thoughtfully. The goal is to ensure the image feels stable and intentional.6. UTILISE NEGATIVE SPACENegative space, the empty areas around your subject, can enhance a photograph by giving the subject room to breathe and stand out. When used effectively, negative space adds simplicity and tranquillity to an image. Be mindful of how much negative space you incorporate. Too much can make your image feel empty, while too little can make it feel cramped. Finding the right balance will enhance the overall impact of your photograph.7. WATCH YOUR BORDERSThe edges of your frame are often overlooked but are crucial for maintaining a clean composition. Distracting elements near the edges of your image can pull attention away from your subject. Before you press the shutter, scan the borders for any distractions or awkward cropping.8. UNDERSTAND DEPTH AND DIMENSIONCreating depth in a photograph helps transform it from a flat, two-dimensional image into a more immersive experience. Using elements like foreground, middle ground, and background layers adds dimensionality, drawing the viewer into the scene. Techniques such as using a wide-angle lens or adjusting your camera position can emphasise depth. A shallow depth of field can isolate your subject while creating layers that add interest to your composition.9. CAPTURE EMOTION, NOT JUST VISUALSThe best pho , drawing the viewer into the scene. Techniques such as using a wide-angle lens or adjusting your camera position can emphasise depth. A shallow depth of field can isolate your subject while creating layers that add interest to your composition.9. CAPTURE EMOTION, NOT JUST VISUALSThe best photographs evoke emotions. By focusing on the mood of your subject , you can convey feelings that resonate deeply with the viewer. Look for small details that inspire wonder or tell a story beyond the scene's superficial appearance.10. USE COLOUR THEORY TO ENHANCE COMPOSITIONColour is a powerful tool in photography . Understanding colour theory can help you create striking images that resonate emotionally with viewers. * Complementary Colours: Pairing opposite colours on the colour wheel, like blue and orange, creates contrast and draws attention to specific areas of your image. * Monochromatic Schemes: Using variations of a single colour can create harmony and cohesion, evoking calm and unity. * Colour to Draw Attention: Use bold or contrasting colours strategically to direct the viewer’s gaze towards focal points within your image.11. MASTER JUXTAPOSITIONJuxtaposition is the art of placing contrasting elements side by side to create a compelling visual narrative. This technique helps draw attention to differences, whether they are between old and new, light and dark , or natural and man-made elements.Contrasting elementsJuxtaposition involves combining elements that are different in nature, creating a visual dialogue within the image. This technique opens the photographer's eyes to the world around them, encouraging them to find amazement in even the smallest details. By pairing contrasting subjects, colours, or textures, photographers can create images that speak beyond superficial aesthetic concerns.Creating visual tensionVisual tension is at the heart of effective juxtaposition. It's about finding the balance between complementary feelings and contrasting elements. The goal is to create images that are not just technically good or classically composed but that transcend their subject matter to evoke emotion and wonder in the viewer.Telling stories through contrastJuxtaposition has the power to tell complex stories within a single frame. By carefully selecting and arranging contrasting elements, photographers can create images that inspire viewers to form their own understanding of the scene. This approach allows photographers to make images with their subjects, rather than simply of them.Juxtaposition adds visual tension and intrigue, encouraging viewers to engage with the image on a deeper level.12. HARNESS THE POWER OF PATTERNS AND REPETITIONPatterns and repetition create rhythm within your image and draw the viewer’s eye through the frame. Look for patterns in nature or architecture and consider breaking them deliberately to emphasise a key element in the photograph. Patterns and repetition in photography composition have the power to create visually striking images that captivate viewers. By recognising and utilising these elements, photographers can add depth, rhythm, and interest to their work.Finding natural patternsNature abounds with patterns, from the intricate designs on leaves to the ripples in sand dunes. Photographers should train their eyes to spot these nat e viewers. By recognising and utilising these elements, photographers can add depth, rhythm, and interest to their work.Finding natural patternsNature abounds with patterns, from the intricate designs on leaves to the ripples in sand dunes. Photographers should train their eyes to spot these natural occurrences. By focusing on these details, they can create images that reveal the wonder in even the smallest elements of the world around us. This approach aligns with the idea of finding amazement in every detail.Creating rhythm in imagesRepetition of shapes, colours, or objects can establish a visual rhythm within a photograph. This rhythm guides the viewer's eye through the image, creating a sense of movement and flow. Photographers can use this technique to express complementary feelings and evoke emotions in their audience. The key is to arrange these repeated elements in a way that transcends mere aesthetics and speaks to a deeper visual narrative.Breaking patterns for emphasisWhile patterns can create harmony, intentionally breaking them can add emphasis to a specific element. This technique, known as a 'pattern interrupt', draws the viewer's attention to a particular point of interest. By strategically placing a contrasting element within a repeating pattern, photographers can create a focal point that enhances the overall composition and tells a more compelling story13. INCORPORATE MOVEMENT AND FLOWMotion in photography, whether captured through motion blur or the use of diagonal lines, adds energy and flow to an image. Experiment with slower shutter speeds to capture motion blur, or use natural elements like rivers or roads to guide the viewer’s eye through the photograph. Incorporating movement into your compositions creates dynamic images that are visually engaging and emotionally powerful.14. EMBRACE IMPERFECTIONPhotography is an art of exploration. Not every shot needs to be perfect, and allowing yourself to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them will help you grow as a photographer. Approach each scene with curiosity and a willingness to see the world differently. Over time, this openness will translate into a more authentic and personal style.15. EDIT YOUR PHOTOS THOUGHTFULLYPost-processing is a crucial step in refining your compositions and learning from your work. Editing not only improves the final image but also serves as a way to review your mistakes and successes in the field. By making time to edit, you train yourself to recognise compositional flaws and strengths, reinforcing lessons that will improve your approach the next time you're behind the camera.IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY COMPOSITIONDownload the 1-page field checklist or book live support.Download 15 Principles Checklist (PDF) Image Reviews Clinic (Zoom, £29) 1-to-1 Mentoring (Zoom) Prefer a text link?

Grasping the subtleties of lighting is crucial as we delve into the minute wonders of our world. Mastering macro techniques ensures that each macro photo is a tribute to your technical prowess and creative vision. * Continuous Light Sources: When we speak of In macro shots, we rely on a constant light source for real-time visualisation of light's effect on our subject. Whether it's the gentle touch of daylight or the focused glow of LED lamps, these sources provide the control needed to fine-tune our lighting environment. Continuous lighting allows us to witness the dance of shadows and highlights, enabling us to adjust and captur of light's effect on our subject. Whether it's the gentle touch of daylight or the focused glow of LED lamps, these sources provide the control needed to fine-tune our lighting environment. Continuous lighting allows us to witness the dance of shadows and highlights, enabling us to adjust and capture the ideal macro pictures. * Flash Lighting Techniques: Capturing the transient beauty of moving subjects, like a buzzing bee or a fluttering butterfly, requires the strategic use of flash lighting, one of the essential macro techniques. The flash's split-second burst of light is our ally in these fleeting moments. The goal when using flash lighting in macro mode is to freeze those ephemeral moments without losing the photo's natural allure. Mastering settings such as manual mode and TTL, along with experimenting with rear curtain sync, allows us to create macro tips-inspired images that are both sharp and vibrant. It's important to balance your flash output with the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture for a harmonious composition. * Harnessing Natural Light and Advanced Tools: While sunlight can be crucial in our macro capture endeavours, incorporating macro techniques often involve a blend of natural and artificial light to enhance our images. High CRI lights, such as LED panels or the versatile These lighting tools, become essential in accurately rendering the true colours and textures of our subjects. When outdoors, employing macro techniques like shooting at ISO 100 with nothing nearby can plunge the background into a deep void, spotlighting your subject as the central figure of the story. * In the interplay of light and lens, we must also consider unpredictable elements. As nature's caprices, like wind gusts, affect our subjects, macro camera settings settings such as autofocus becomes our ally. Moreover, for those aiming to overcome depth of field constraints, focus stacking is a macro photography technique that merges multiple images, each with a distinct focus point, into a single, detail-rich photograph. By mastering these techniques and tips, we do more than just capture images; we weave stories that pay homage to the hidden marvels of our world. As we delve deeper into macro mode, let these strategies illuminate our path to novel artistic vistas.UNDERSTANDING AND CONTROLLING DEPTH OF FIELDQUICK TIPS — DEPTH OF FIELD CONTROL * Use higher f-stop (e.g. f/16) for broader sharpness—counter with shutter or ISO. * Step back and zoom in to expand DOF naturally. * Focus stacking combines multiple focus planes into one sharp image. * Smaller light sources help maintain consistent lighting even at narrow apertures.In the precise choreography of macro photos, controlling the depth of field (DoF) is like a maestro directing an orchestra—each tweak in aperture results in a perfect blend of focus and blur. Here, we explore the macro settings to command this critical element: * Aperture Adjustments: One of the key macro photography tips for manipulating DoF is the aperture setting. A narrow aperture (higher f-stop number) broadens the depth of field, making more of your subject crisp and clear. This, however, necessitates a trade-off with either a longer shutter speed or a higher ISO for correct exposure. On the flip side, a wider aperture (lower f-stop number) will isolate your subject against a delicately blurred backdrop, accentuating the fine details and textures that characterise it. * Distan ver, necessitates a trade-off with either a longer shutter speed or a higher ISO for correct exposure. On the flip side, a wider aperture (lower f-stop number) will isolate your subject against a delicately blurred backdrop, accentuating the fine details and textures that characterise it. * Distance Dynamics: The distance between your camera and the subject also markedly affects DoF. Increasing the camera-to-subject distance results in a more extensive field of focus, ensuring more of your subject is sharply defined. This photography technique encourages us to sometimes step back and reframe our compositions, keeping the vital elements in sharp focus while still conveying the essence of * Lighting and DoF: Integrating macro techniques, a smaller light source placed near the subject can emit a soft light that enhances depth of field (DoF) management. This approach allows for the use of a narrower aperture without compromising the quality of light, ensuring that macro photos maintain the intricate interplay of shadows and highlights that vivify the subject. * Focus Stacking Mastery: For those dedicated to achieving the ultimate depth of field at a specific magnification, focus stacking is a critical macro images. It requires capturing multiple images at varying focus distances and blending them with software. The outcome is a composite image with the sharpness that spans the entire subject, though the process is time-intensive. ensures that every detail from the foreground to the background is in exquisite focus. * Cropping and Enlargement: When seeking a deeper DoF leads to a compromise in image size, cropping emerges as a strategic tool. It allows photographers to simulate an expanded depth of field by reducing the field of view. Advanced software can then enlarge the cropped image, compensating for the loss of detail from a lower megapixel count. Advanced software can be employed to magnify the cropped image, ensuring that the quality is preserved and that the macro image examples maintain their striking effect. * Magnification Control: Lastly, the magnification level is a pivotal factor to consider. By increasing the distance from the subject or using extension tubes, photographers can adjust the magnification, which in turn modifies the DoF. These strategic adjustments are essential for capturing macro photos with precision. Photographers can select the appropriate aperture and lighting to capture macro images that are technically impeccable and visually stunning. By applying these techniques, we deftly balance sharpness and bokeh, creating images that echo the profound beauty of the miniature world. Each macro photography idea we experiment with is a chance to hone our craft and broaden our artistic horizons.View fullsize UNDERSTANDING MAGNIFICATION AND WORKING DISTANCEQUICK TIPS — MAGNIFICATION & DISTANCE * 1:1 magnification is true macro—subject gets life-sized on sensor. * Know your lens’s MFD so you can get close without casting shadows. * Extend working distance for lighting flexibility and less disturbance.In our quest for mastery in macro techniques, grasping the nuances of magnification and working distance is pivotal.

Mixing up focal length, perspective, and crop factor leads to warped faces, weak compositions, and background chaos. Zooming your feet vs zooming the lens isn’t the same—and that’s where most shots go wrong.This post solves it: You’ll learn what focal length really is, how it changes angle of view, influences the background size/blur for the same framing, and how sensor size (crop factor) affects your lens choices—so you pick the right focal length on purpose.3 key takeaways 1. Angle of view: shorter focal lengths include more scene; longer focal lengths narrow the view and magnify the background for the same framing. 2. Perspective = camera position: move your feet to change shape relationships; changing focal length without moving only crops/widens the view. 3. Crop factor: to compare framing, use focal length × crop (APS-C≈1.5×, MFT≈2×); DoF equivalence for the same framing needs a higher f-number on smaller sensors.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION TO WHAT IS FOCAL LENGTH IN PHOTOGRAPHYUnderstanding what focal length is in photography significantly influences the visual outcome of an image.

The focal length is the distance between the lens and the point where light converges, which determines perspective, composition, and overall aesthetic. Understanding the focal length explained is crucial for photographers of all levels. The lens focal length measures the distance between the lens and the point where light converges. This interplay between optics and physics shapes the angle of view of photography. This guide explores the focal length's intricacies, impact on genres, and creative possibilities. Gain a profound understanding to elevate your photographic prowess.WHAT IS FOCAL LENGTH AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT YOUR PHOTOS?The focal length definition, measured in millimetres, defines a camera lens's optical characteristics and angle of view. A shorter focal length, like a wide-angle lens, captures a broader field of view, ideal for landscapes, interiors, or group shots. A longer focal length, like a telephoto lens, narrows the angle of view, useful for isolating subjects or freezing action. The focal length formula also affects depth of field, with shorter lengths providing greater sharpness and longer lengths producing background blur. Understanding the focal length equation helps photographers choose lenses and compose images that align with their artistic vision.DIFFERENT TYPES OF LENSES AND THEIR FOCAL LENGTHSFOCAL LENGTH & LENS TYPES — ANGLE OF VIEW, USES & TIPSLens type Typical focal length (FF) Approx. diagonal AoV Look / perspective Best for (examples) Handy tips Fisheye 8–15 mm ~180° Extreme bend/curvature; huge coverage.

Please wait for this before rushing out thinking you need to buy x, y or z lenses to cover your interests. If you do need a lens urgently I recommend hiring for a period rather than buying. Lenslab has a vast array of choices to suit all camera brands, types and needs and provides excellent customer service.UNDERSTANDING THE CONCEPT OF PERSPECTIVE IN PHOTOGRAPHYPerspective in photography is linked to focal length. Wide-angle lenses exaggerate foreground objects, creating depth and immersion. Telephoto lenses compress distance, flattening the perspective. Understanding perspective is crucial for controlling the visual narrative and evoking emotional responses.FOCAL LENGTH AND ITS IMPACT ON COMPOSITIONQUICK TIPS — FOCAL LENGTH & COMPOSITION * Set perspective first: move your feet to the best camera position, then pick a focal length to frame it. * Control background size: longer focal lengths magnify the background for the same subject size; wide lenses make it feel smaller. * Use foreground with wides: get close to a strong near object to add depth and exaggerate leading lines. * Use teles to simplify: step back and zoom in to remove clutter, stack layers, and isolate subjects. * Mind edge stretch: keep faces and verticals away from frame edges at 24–28 mm; keep the camera level to reduce keystoning. * Balance negative space: wide = breathing room and context; tele = tighter, subject-led balance. * Keep it sharp: hand-held shutter ≈ 1/(focal length × crop); stabilisation or support helps at 100 mm+. * Perspective ≠ focal length: only changing position alters perspective; zooming in/out just crops or widens the view.Wide-angle (14–35 mm) * Include environment & strong foregrounds * Exaggerate depth & converging lines * Great for landscapes, interiors, streetTelephoto (85–300 mm+) * Compress layers; larger-looking backgrounds * Clean up edges; remove distractions * Great for portraits, details, wildlifeComposition is the artful arrangement of visual elements within the frame, and focal length plays a pivotal role in shaping the compositional possibilities of an image. By understanding the relationship between focal length and composition, photographers can unlock new creative avenues and elevate their storytelling abilities. 1. Framing and subject placement: The choice of focal length directly influences the framing and subject placement within the composition. Wide-angle lenses allow for the inclusion of more environmental context, making them ideal for capturing expansive scenes or emphasising foreground elements. Conversely, telephoto lenses enable the isolation of subject gth directly influences the framing and subject placement within the composition. Wide-angle lenses allow for the inclusion of more environmental context, making them ideal for capturing expansive scenes or emphasising foreground elements. Conversely, telephoto lenses enable the isolation of subjects, facilitating the creation of intimate portraits or extracting intricate details from a larger scene. 2. Depth perception and layering: Focal length plays a crucial role in shaping the perception of depth and layering within a composition. Wide-angle lenses exaggerate the distance between foreground and background elements, creating a sense of depth and dimensionality. Telephoto lenses, on the other hand, compress the perceived distance, flattening the perspective and allowing for the seamless integration of multiple layers within the frame. 3. Leading lines and visual flow: The angle of view captured by different focal lengths can significantly impact the presence and effectiveness of leading lines within a composition . Wide-angle lenses can enhance the prominence of converging lines, guiding the viewer's eye through the frame, while telephoto lenses can isolate and emphasise specific lines or patterns, creating a more focused visual narrative. 4. Negative space and balance: The choice of focal length influences the balance and negative space within a composition. Wide-angle lenses can create a sense of expansiveness , allowing for the incorporation of negative space as a compositional element. Telephoto lenses, conversely, can compress the scene, minimising negative space and creating a more intimate, subject-focused composition.By understanding the compositional implications of focal length, photographers can make informed decisions that align with their creative vision, crafting visually compelling images that captivate and engage the viewer.CHOOSING THE RIGHT FOCAL LENGTH FOR DIFFERENT PHOTOGRAPHY GENRESQUICK TIPS — CHOOSE THE RIGHT FOCAL LENGTH BY GENRE * Landscape — 24–35 mm for context; 70–200 mm to isolate forms and compress layers. Wide (<24 mm) only when a strong foreground anchors the frame. * Portraits — 50–85 mm for half/three-quarter; 85–135 mm for headshots and background blur. Keep subjects away from edges at wider FLs. * Street / Documentary — 28–35 mm for environmental context; 40–50 mm for a natural look without distortion. Prime keeps you light and fast. * Sports / Action — 70–200 mm sideline all-rounder; 300–400 mm+ for field sports. Pair with fast shutter and support (monopod/IBIS). * Macro — 90–105 mm (or 60 mm close-working) for 1:1 detail. Stop down, add light (flash/diffuser), and consider focus rail/stacking. * Wildlife / Birds — 400–600 mm+ for reach; use higher shutters and pre-focus on perches/flight paths to improve hit-rate. * Travel / Events — 24–70 mm covers scenes + people; add 70–200 mm for stage or candid compression. * Architecture / Interiors — 16–24 mm to fit space; keep camera level or use a tilt-shift to manage verticals.Notes: Focal length sets angle of view; perspective comes from camera position. On APS-C multiply by ~1.5× (Canon 1.6×), on Micro 4/3 by ~2× to get full-frame equivalents. There’s no hard rule—pick the focal length that best supports the picture idea.Each photographic genre presents its own unique challenges and creative demands, and the choice of focal length plays a cr ion. On APS-C multiply by ~1.5× (Canon 1.6×), on Micro 4/3 by ~2× to get full-frame equivalents. There’s no hard rule—pick the focal length that best supports the picture idea.Each photographic genre presents its own unique challenges and creative demands, and the choice of focal length plays a crucial role in achieving the desired visual outcome. By understanding the strengths and limitations of different focal lengths, photographers can make informed decisions that align with their artistic goals. 1. Landscape photography: For breathtaking landscape shots, wide-angle lenses are often the assumed choice. Their expansive field of view allows for the capture of vast scenes, emphasising the grandeur of natural environments. Focal lengths ranging from 14mm to 24mm are commonly used, enabling photographers to encompass sweeping vistas and create a sense of immersion. However, as a landscape shooter I rarely shoot with less than 24mm focal length and frequently use a 70-200mm focal length to isolate and frame my subject in the landscape environment. Therefore, no rule relates to focal lengths in the landscape; it is just the right focal length to do the job and create the aesthetics desired. 2. Portrait photography: When it comes to portraiture, focal lengths between 50mm and 135mm are widely favoured. These lenses provide a natural perspective, minimizing distortion and ensuring flattering representations of facial features. Longer focal lengths, such as 85mm or 135mm, create a pleasing background blur, allowing for subject isolation and enhanced depth perception. 3. Street photography: The dynamic and spontaneous nature of street photography often calls for versatile focal lengths. Prime lens in the 35mm to 50mm range offer a natural perspective, while wider focal lengths, like 24mm or 28mm, can capture environmental context and create a sense of immersion in urban settings. 4. Sports and action photography: In the fast-paced world of sports and action photography, telephoto lenses reign supreme. Focal lengths ranging from 70mm to 400mm or beyond allow photographers to capture subjects from a safe distance, freeze motion, and isolate the action from the surrounding environment. 5. Macro photography: For exploring the intricate details of the natural world, macro lenses are indispensable. These specialised lenses, typically ranging from 60mm to 110mm, enable photographers to capture life-size or greater magnifications, revealing the intricate textures and patterns that often go unnoticed by the naked eye. 6. Wildlife photography: Super-telephoto lenses are the go-to choice when photographing elusive and often distant subjects in their natural habitats. Focal lengths of 400mm, 500mm, or even 600mm and beyond allow photographers to capture intimate moments without disturbing or disrupting the subjects' natural behaviour.By understanding the unique demands of each photographic genre, photographers can make informed decisions about lens selection, maximising the creative potential of their equipment and capturing images that resonate with their artistic vision.PRACTICAL TIPS FOR USING DIFFERENT FOCAL LENGTHSMASTER FOCAL LENGTH CHOICES IN THE FIELDDownload the 1-page field checklist with perspective tips, angle of view, and on-location drills.Download Focal Length Checklist (PDF) [https://www.alanranger.com/s/Focal_Length_Field_Checklist.pdf?utm_source=utm_source%3Dblog&utm_medium=utm_medium%3Dcta&utm_campaign=utm_cam",

These essential pieces of used photography equipment open up a realm of creative possibilities, allowing photographers to experiment with different perspectives and styles . As aspiring photographers and self-reflective individuals embark on their journey of personal growth, they often grapple with the decision of whether to buy new lenses, opt for used camera lenses, or explore rental options.The choice between new, used camera equipment, or rented camera lenses has an impact on various aspects of a photographer's experience. This article delves into the cost considerations, quality and performance factors, and the flexibility and convenience offered by each option. By examining these key elements, readers will gain insights to help them make informed decisions about their lens purchases or rentals, considering factors such as warranty coverage, the potential for scratches or fungus in second-hand lenses, and the benefits of weather sealing in new models.COST CONSIDERATIONSNEW LENS PRICINGWhen considering new camera lenses, photographers often face significant expenses. High-quality glass, superior body construction, and precision-engineered optics contribute to the hefty price tags. For ins and the benefits of weather sealing in new models.COST CONSIDERATIONSNEW LENS PRICINGWhen considering new camera lenses, photographers often face significant expenses. High-quality glass, superior body construction, and precision-engineered optics contribute to the hefty price tags. For instance, a Sony lens for sale, like the FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II, costs well over GBP 2,400 . As a general rule, new lenses typically retain 70-80% of their retail price, making them a substantial investment for aspiring photographers.USED LENS VALUEThe used camera gear market offers a more budget-friendly alternative. To determine fair pricing, photographers can explore various platforms such as MPB, classified ads websites, and camera shops selling used cameras. When comparing prices, it's crucial to consider factors like condition, included accessories, and remaining warranty. Used camera lenses in excellent condition can retain up to 80% of their retail price, while less popular or poorly maintained second-hand lenses might sell for as little as 10% of their original cost. As an example, the Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II used (but as new condition) can be purchased for GBP 2,300 on MPB , and the following condition down (excellent) only drops to GBP 2,100RENTAL COSTSRenting lenses provides flexibility and variety without the long-term financial commitment. Interestingly, rental prices for camera bodies often exceed those of lenses. For example, a rental place in the UK charges GBP 16.00 per day for a Sony used camera body, while the Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II lens costs only GBP 14.00 per day to rent . This pricing discrepancy may be due to factors such as the shorter lifespan of camera bodies, higher maintenance requirements, and increased fragility compared to lenses.OptionProsConsNewLatest technology, full warrantyHighest costUsedLower price, good value retentionPotential wear and tearRentalFlexibility, access to various lensesOngoing costs, limited availabilityQUALITY AND PERFORMANCENEW LENS TECHNOLOGYThe world of camera lenses has an impact on the creative possibilities for photographers. New lenses often feature cutting-edge technology, offering superior optical quality and innovative features. For instance, the Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 for Nikon's mirrorless cameras exemplifies this trend, promising to be a classic for reportage, street, and event photography. Similarly, the Sigma 18-50mm F2.8 DC DN Contemporary has proven its worth for Canon APS-C cameras, showcasing how newer lenses can enhance image quality and versatility.USED LENS CONDITIONWhen considering used camera lenses, a thorough inspection is crucial. Wear and tear are inevitable, especially on lenses used by professionals. Minor scuffs and paint wear on the filter ring or rubberised zoom rings are usual and don't affect optical performance. However, dents on the barrel deserve scrutiny, as they may indicate misalignment of precision optics. Examining the front and rear glass elements is essential; tiny scuffs usually won't affect image quality, but scratches on the rear element are more concerning. It's also vital to check for fungus inside the dents on the barrel deserve scrutiny, as they may indicate misalignment of precision optics. Examining the front and rear glass elements is essential; tiny scuffs usually won't affect image quality, but scratches on the rear element are more concerning. It's also vital to check for fungus inside the lens, which can cause permanent damage if left untreated. MPB do a thorough check and grades their equipment accurately so you know what to expect.MPB’S FIVE COSMETIC CONDITIONS: * Like new: As if your item(s) were brand new out of the box. Little to no sign of wear to the body or casing. Minimal or no dust, marks, or paint defects are present. * Excellent: Minor signs of wear to the body or casing. Light dust, marks, and paint defects may be present. * Good: Noticeable signs of wear to rubber grips, ports or other components. Dust, marks, and paint defects may be present. * Well used: Distinct signs of wear and light scuffs to rubber grips, ports or other components. Considerable dust, marks, and paint defects may be present. * Heavily used: Significant signs of wear, heavy marks, or scuffs to rubber grips, ports, or other components. Heavy dust, marks, and paint defects may be present.RENTAL LENS MAINTENANCERenting lenses offers flexibility, but proper care is essential. Upon receiving rented equipment, thorough inspection and testing of all features are crucial. Throughout the rental period, handle the gear with care, using appropriate cleaning tools and techniques. Avoid exposing the equipment to extreme conditions. Before returning, perform a final inspection and clean the equipment thoroughly. Rental services often employ strategies like security deposits, insurance coverage, and rigorous quality control to manage risks associated with lens rentals.OptionQuality AssuranceMaintenance ResponsibilityNewLatest technology, full warrantyUserUsedVaries, requires inspectionUserRentalRegular checks by serviceShared between user and serviceFLEXIBILITY AND CONVENIENCEOWNING VS RENTINGThe choice between owning and renting camera lenses has an impact on a photographer's creative journey. Owning lenses provides constant access but requires significant investment. Renting, on the other hand, offers flexibility and cost-effectiveness for occasional use. For instance, a 24mm Canon Tilt Shift Lens, while not an everyday tool, can be an exciting weekend rental for city photography.LONG-TERM VS SHORT-TERM NEEDSPhotographers must weigh their long-term and short-term needs. Renting is ideal for specific jobs or experimenting with new styles. It allows photographers to factor rental costs into client bids, ensuring equipment availability without tying up cash flow. However, frequent rentals of the same equipment may indicate a need for purchase, as it becomes more cost-effective and convenient in the long run.TRY BEFORE YOU BUYMany brands offer 'Try Before You Buy ' schemes, allowing photographers to test equipment in real-world situations. Canon's free Test Drive service , for example, delivers a wide range of products to your home. This approach helps photographers make informed decisions, especially when choosing between options like a 35mm Canon Prime or a 16-35mm Sony lens. It's a valuable opportunity to explore and refine one's photograph canon.co.uk/testdrive/], for example, delivers a wide range of products to your home. This approach helps photographers make informed decisions, especially when choosing between options like a 35mm Canon Prime or a 16-35mm Sony lens. It's a valuable opportunity to explore and refine one's photographic style before committing to a purchase.RENTING LENSES: FLEXIBILITY AND VARIETYRenting camera lenses offers photographers a world of creative possibilities without the burden of hefty investments. This approach has an impact on both professional and hobbyist photographers, providing access to cutting-edge equipment and specialised gear for specific projects.SHORT-TERM SOLUTIONSRenting lenses proves invaluable for short-term needs, such as once-in-a-lifetime holidays or destination trips. It allows photographers to tailor their gear to the unique demands of each project, ensuring they have the right tools without the long-term commitment. For instance, a photographer might rent a specialised underwater camera for a tropical holiday, enhancing their creative options without purchasing expensive equipment they may rarely use.TRYING DIFFERENT LENSESOne of the most significant advantages of renting is the opportunity to experiment with various lenses. This 'try before you buy' approach enables photographers to test equipment in real-world situations, helping them make informed decisions about future purchases. Whether it's exploring the effects of a wide-angle lens for landscapes, a telephoto lens for wildlife, or a macro lens for detailed close-ups, renting allows for hands-on experience and creative exploration.RENTAL PROVIDERSSeveral companies offer lens rental services, each with unique features. Lenslab , for example, provides convenient online rentals with home delivery and easy return options via couriers; I can also provide you with a discount code as one of my clients if you want to try them out. These services often include comprehensive insurance coverage, protecting renters against potential damage or loss. When choosing a rental provider, photographers should consider factors such as rental duration flexibility, insurance options, and the range of equipment available.OptionAdvantagesConsiderationsShort-term RentalFlexibility for specific projectsCost-effective for occasional useTry Before BuyHands-on experience before purchasingHelps inform buying decisionsRental ProvidersWide range of equipment availableCompare insurance and delivery optionsCONCLUSIONThe decision to buy used cameras or rent camera lenses has a significant impact on a photographer's journey. Aspiring photographers should carefully consider their needs and financial situation. Renting offers flexibility and access to specialised equipment without a long-term commitment. It's ideal for trying different lenses before purchasing, especially for specific projects or infrequent use. However, owning gear can be cost-effective for frequently used items and allows photographers to build rental fees into project budgets. Ultimately, the choice depends on individual circumstances, photographic style, and long-term goals. By making informed decisions, photographers can enhance their creativity and grow their craft without unnecessary financial burden.----------------------------------------FAQS - CAMERA LENSES: WHEN TO BUY NEW, USED, OR RENTShould I consider renting a lens before purchasing one?Absolutely, renting le g informed decisions, photographers can enhance their creativity and grow their craft without unnecessary financial burden.----------------------------------------FAQS - CAMERA LENSES: WHEN TO BUY NEW, USED, OR RENTShould I consider renting a lens before purchasing one?Absolutely, renting lenses before buying is highly recommended. This approach allows you to test various lenses to determine which best meets your needs, helping you make a more informed decision and avoid potential regrets about your purchase.Is purchasing a second-hand camera lens advisable?Yes, buying a used camera lens can be a good option. Camera lenses are built to last, and acquiring one in good condition can serve you well for a prolonged period. This is particularly true for filmmakers using DSLRs, as there are excellent deals to be found on vintage manual focus lenses.How should I go about selecting a camera lens to purchase?When choosing a camera lens, consider the following: 1. Identify the subjects or events you wish to photograph. 2. Determine the type of lens that suits your photography needs, such as prime lenses, zoom lenses, wide-angle lenses, or telephoto lenses. 3. Decide on your preferred aperture settings for controlling depth of field and bokeh. 4. Ensure the lens mount is compatible with your camera model. 5. Read user reviews to gauge lens performance, sharpness, distortion, chromatic aberration, and overall satisfaction. 6. If possible, test the lens personally to ensure it meets your expectations in terms of optical quality, autofocus speed, image stabilisation, and handling.What checks should I perform before purchasing a second-hand camera lens?Before buying a used camera lens, it's crucial to verify its focus functionality and inspect for any physical damage. A practical tip is to take a photograph of a plain white or brightly lit wall to check for scratches or imperfections in the image. Additionally, familiarise yourself with the lens's features, such as focal length, lens coatings, size, weight, and durability, and compare them to other lenses to ensure you're getting a good deal. Researching the lens resale value can also help you make an informed decision when buying second hand camera gear.----------------------------------------photography-tips , online photography course Alan Ranger 23 April 2025essential gear guides , tips LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 [",

JPEGs are small, shareable and look good straight out of camera, but they’re compressed and 8-bit. RAW files keep far more data (12/14-bit), giving you headroom for white balance, exposure and colour in editing.This guide shows when to shoot JPEG for speed and consistency, and when RAW (or RAW+JPEG) protects highlights, colours and detail—especially in tricky light.3 key takeaways 1. Flexibility: RAW preserves dynamic range and colour depth (better highlight/shadow recovery & white balance changes). JPEG bakes settings in. 2. File size & speed: JPEGs are smaller and faster for burst/action and quick delivery; RAW is larger and needs editing time. 3. Choose by intent: Controlled light or quick social delivery → JPEG. High-contrast, mixed light, critical quality or prints → RAW (or RAW+JPEG for safety).Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------JPEG VS RAW: UNRAVELING THE GREAT DEBATE FOR ASPIRING PHOTOGRAPHERSINTRODUCTIONAs a budding photographer, you've likely encountered the age-old question: JPEG Vs RAW?

It's a decision that can significantly impact your workflow and the final image quality of your photos. Let's dive into this crucial topic of jpeg vs raw and uncover the secrets that will elevate your professional photography game.THE BASICS: JPEG AND RAW UNVEILEDRAW VS JPEG — WHAT THE CAMERA ACTUALLY SAVESJPEG is a finished file the camera processes for you; RAW is the sensor data with minimal processing kept for editing. Same scene, different pipeline and flexibility.Diagram showing in-camera processing for RAW and JPEG.For RAW: Sensor goes directly to the memory card with minimal processing, keeping 12/14-bit data and larger, flexible files. For JPEG: Sensor goes through the processor which applies white balance, tone curve, noise reduction, sharpening and 8-bit compression before saving a smaller file to the card.RAW (Sensor Data) SENSOR MEMORY CARD 12/14-bit Larger, flexible Minimal in-camera processing • Best for grading JPEG (Processed File) SENSOR PROCESSOR WB • Tone • NR • Sharpen • Compress MEMORY CARD 8-bit Smaller, ready Looks good fast • Less editing latitudeUse JPEG when: speed, long bursts, consistent light, quick web delivery.Use RAW when: high DR, mixed/low light, colour-critical work, large prints.Tip: need both? Shoot RAW+JPEG — deliver fast, grade later.JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is like the fast food of photography – quick, convenient, and ready to consume right away. When you shoot in the JPEG format, your camera processes the image data, applies compression, and serves you a finished jpeg photo. It's the go-to format for many because of the benefits of jpeg like universal compatibility and smaller file sizes.RAW, on the other hand, is the gourmet meal of image formats. It's the unprocessed, uncompressed camera sensor data straight from your camera. Think of a raw image as the digital equivalent of a film negative – it contains all the ingredients needed to create a stunning final photo, but it requires some culinary skill (read: post-processing) to bring out its full potential and realize the true raw photo meaning.WHEN TO USE JPEG VS RAW: THE ART OF CHOICEChoosing between shooting in raw vs jpeg isn't about right or wrong – it's about matching the format to your needs. Here's a quick guide:Choose JPEG when: 1. You need images ready for immediate use (e.g., event photography with quick turnaround) 2. Storage space is at a premium (think long trips with limited memory cards) 3. You're shooting for web use or social media where ultimate image quality isn't crucial 4. You're capturing fast-action sequences and need your camera's buffer to keep upOpt for RAW when: 1. You're shooting in challenging lighting conditions like low-light photography 2. The scene has a high dynamic range (think sunset landscapes) 3. You want maximum flexibility in post-processing 4. You're working on professional photography projects or images destined for large printsJPEG VS RAW — WHEN TO USE EACH + PROS & CONSFormat Use when… Why Pros Cons JPEG * Images needed immediately (events, social, news) * Storage is tight (long trips, small cards) * Consistent light; WB looks correct in-camera * Fast action where buffer/fps matters * Web delivery where ultimate latitude isn’t criticalIn-camera processing creates a finished file (contrast, NR, s Images needed immediately (events, social, news) * Storage is tight (long trips, small cards) * Consistent light; WB looks correct in-camera * Fast action where buffer/fps matters * Web delivery where ultimate latitude isn’t criticalIn-camera processing creates a finished file (contrast, NR, sharpening, WB) with small size for fast transfer and long bursts. * Smaller files * Ready out of camera * Faster to share/process * Universal compatibility * Longer bursts / less buffer stress * Limited editing latitude * Lossy compression artifacts possible * 8-bit tonal range (banding risk) * WB/contrast/NR are baked in * Weaker highlight/shadow recoveryRAW * Challenging light or mixed WB * High dynamic range scenes (sunset, interiors) * Maximum flexibility in post * Professional work / large prints * Critical colour/exposure accuracySensor data kept at 12/14-bit with minimal processing, preserving tonal and colour information for robust editing. * Maximum image quality/detail * Greater tonal range & colour depth * Stronger highlight/shadow recovery * WB changes are lossless in post * Non-destructive editing workflow * Larger files; more storage needed * Requires post-processing time * Can slow bursts / fill buffer sooner * Needs compatible software (RAW codec)Tip: If you need speed and a safety net, shoot RAW+JPEG—deliver JPEGs fast, keep RAWs for critical selects.POST-PROCESSING POWER: UNLEASHING YOUR CREATIVE VISIONEDITING TIPS — RAW (MAXIMUM LATITUDE) * Recover more, destroy less: RAW (12/14-bit) gives headroom for Highlights/Shadows. Sunset a bit dark? Lift shadows without crunchy noise. Bride’s dress a touch hot? Pull Highlights/Whites to recover texture. * White balance after the fact: WB is metadata in RAW—set it in post using a grey card, skin tones, or neutral points. No quality loss vs JPEG’s baked WB. * Edit in a safe order: profile → WB → exposure → Highlights/Shadows → contrast/curve → HSL → local adjustments → noise reduction → sharpening. * Protect highlights at capture: RAW is generous, not magic—blown channels are gone. Aim to preserve highlights, then raise shadows in post. * Noise first, detail second: apply modest luminance NR, then masked/detail sharpening; add micro-contrast locally (eyes, textures) rather than globally. * Deliver cleanly: export JPEGs for web/social, 16-bit TIFF for print/retouch. Keep the RAW as your non-destructive master.Real-world: wedding highlight rescue—RAW often saves a slightly overexposed white dress; JPEG usually cannot.EDITING TIPS — JPEG (WORK GENTLY ON 8-BIT FILES) * Small moves, local tools: keep exposure/contrast tweaks subtle (≈±0.3–0.5 EV). Prefer local adjustments over global to avoid posterisation/banding. * WB with care: big WB shifts reveal artifacts. Nudge Temp/Tint slightly; refine colour with HSL rather than heavy global changes. * One save at the end: JPEG is lossy—convert to a working 16-bit TIFF/PSD for heavier edits, then export a final JPEG once. * Artifact control: use moderate noise reduction and restrained sharpening; mask edges to avoid halos on skies/skin. * Leaning bright? Re-shoot or RAW: clipped highlights in JPEG can’t be recovered—capture again or use RAW next time in tricky light.STORAGE & WORKFLOW — RAW VS JPEG * Typical 24MP sizes: JPEG ~7–10 MB; RAW ~20–30 MB+. On a 64 GB card (approx.): ~6,400 JPEGs vs ~2,100 RAWs (camera/scene dependent). * Burst & buffer: JPEG sustains longer bursts; RAW fills can’t be recovered—capture again or use RAW next time in tricky light.STORAGE & WORKFLOW — RAW VS JPEG * Typical 24MP sizes: JPEG ~7–10 MB; RAW ~20–30 MB+. On a 64 GB card (approx.): ~6,400 JPEGs vs ~2,100 RAWs (camera/scene dependent). * Burst & buffer: JPEG sustains longer bursts; RAW fills buffers sooner. For action, consider RAW+JPEG or use compressed RAW to balance quality and speed. * Ingest & backup: 3-2-1 rule (3 copies, 2 media, 1 off-site). Cull quickly using embedded previews; keep RAW masters for selects and export JPEGs for delivery. * Space savers: use lossless/efficient RAW compression; archive only final selects; optional DNG conversion to reduce size (test your workflow first). * Choose by intent: fast turnaround/social → JPEG; high DR/mixed light/print or pro work → RAW (or RAW+JPEG safety net).PRACTICAL EXAMPLES: SEEING IS BELIEVINGLet's dive into some real-world scenarios to illustrate the differences: 1. Landscape Photography: Imagine capturing a stunning mountain vista at sunrise. The scene has a wide dynamic range – bright sky, shadowy foreground. Shooting in raw allows you to recover details in both the highlights and shadows, creating a more balanced and impactful image. 2. Portrait Photography: You're shooting portraits in a dimly lit room. With RAW format, you can push the exposure in post-processing without introducing as much noise as you would with a JPEG format file. This flexibility can be the difference between a usable professional photography portrait and a noisy, unusable image. 3. Sports Photography: You're capturing a fast-paced basketball game. Shooting in raw vs jpeg here favours JPEG, as it allows your camera to write files to the memory card more quickly, reducing buffer slowdowns and ensuring you don't miss that game-winning shot.TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE: FOR THE CURIOUS MINDSFor those hungry for more technical details, let's explore a bit deeper:Bit Depth: JPEG format files are typically 8-bit, representing 256 levels per colour channel. RAW format files are often 12-bit or 14-bit, allowing for thousands or even tens of thousands of levels per channel. This translates to smoother tonal range transitions and more flexibility in editing.Colour Space: JPEGs are usually saved in the sRGB colour space, which is great for web display but limited in range. RAW format files aren't bound to a specific colour space, allowing you to choose the best option for your output medium during image processing.Compression: JPEG format uses lossy compression, discarding some color information to reduce file size. RAW format files are either uncompressed or use lossless compression, preserving all the original camera sensor data captured.THE VERDICT: FINDING YOUR PATHSo, raw vs jpg? The answer, as with many things in professional photography, is that it depends. As a photography student or amateur photographer, experimenting with both RAW format and JPEG format is crucial to understanding their strengths and limitations.Consider starting with JPEG format to build your compositional skills and understanding of exposure control. As you grow more confident and start pushing the boundaries of your creativity, introduce RAW format into your workflow to take advantage of its superior colour accuracy, shadow recovery, highlight recovery, noise reduction, and sharpening capabilities. Many photographers end up using both, choosing the raw image format or jpeg photo format based on the spe of your creativity, introduce RAW format into your workflow to take advantage of its superior colour accuracy, shadow recovery, highlight recovery, noise reduction, and sharpening capabilities. Many photographers end up using both, choosing the raw image format or jpeg photo format based on the specific requirements of each shoot.Remember, the most important thing is not the format you choose but the vision and creativity you bring to your professional photography.

WHAT IS A JPEG FILE?Answer: JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a commonly used digital image format that compresses image files to reduce their size. This compression can lead to some loss of image quality, but JPEGs are widely supported by software and devices, making them convenient for storage and sharing.2. WHAT IS A RAW FILE?Answer: A RAW file is an unprocessed image file that captures all the data from a camera’s sensor without any processing or compression. RAW files contain more image data than JPEGs, allowing for greater flexibility in post-processing.3. WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN JPEG AND RAW?Answer: The main differences between JPEG and RAW include: * File Size: JPEG files are smaller due to compression, while RAW files are significantly larger. * Image Quality: RAW files maintain higher quality and detail, while JPEGs may lose some quality due to compression. * Editing Flexibility: RAW files provide more latitude for editing, allowing adjustments to exposure, white balance, and more without degrading the image quality. * Processing: JPEG files are processed in-camera, meaning they are ready to use immediately, while RAW files require post-processing.4. WHEN SHOULD I USE JPEG INSTEAD OF RAW?Answer: JPEG is ideal when you need smaller file sizes for quick sharing, have limited storage, or require images immediately without the need for extensive post-processing. It’s also suitable for casual photography where maximum quality is less of a concern.5. WHEN SHOULD I USE RAW INSTEAD OF JPEG?Answer: Use RAW when you want the highest quality images and plan to do extensive editing in post-processing.

This lesson shows you how to pick the right speed to either freeze action or creatively blur it, and how to balance shutter with aperture and ISO to keep exposure on target and get sharp photos. * Match speed to subject: people 1/250–1/500s, sports 1/1000–1/2000s; water/light trails 1/2–2s for motion blur. * Stay sharp handheld: use the 1/(2× focal length) rule; stabilise or raise ISO if you drop below it. * Balance the triangle: if you speed up the shutter, open the aperture or raise ISO (and vice-versa) to keep the meter reading.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------WHAT IS SHUTTER SPEED IN PHOTOGRAPHY?INTRODUCTIONShutter speed is a fundamental concept in photography, acting as a critical determinant of both the exposure and aesthetic quality of an image. Understanding what is shutter speed in a camera, and mastering its adjustments, can transform an amateur into an adept photographer. This vital setting controls the duration a camera's sensor is exposed to light, significantly impacting the outcome of a photograph. It is the key to capturing everything from the serene stillness of a landscape to the dynamic action of a sporting event. Whether exploring the nuances of slow shutter speed to create motion blur, or u ration a camera's sensor is exposed to light, significantly impacting the outcome of a photograph. It is the key to capturing everything from the serene stillness of a landscape to the dynamic action of a sporting event. Whether exploring the nuances of slow shutter speed to create motion blur, or utilising a fast shutter speed to freeze a moment in time, knowledge of how shutter speed affects a photo is indispensable.The upcoming sections will delve into the basic concepts of shutter speed, its pivotal role in photography, and how it interplays with other camera settings such as ISO and aperture. Readers will learn about the importance of selecting the right shutter speed for various scenarios, from what shutter speed to use in dim light, to the benefits of a slow shutter speed for artistic effects. Practical tips for mastering shutter speed, supported by a shutter speed chart, will equip photographers to take control of their imaging process, enhancing both their skill set and creative expression. This comprehensive guide aims to answer pressing questions like \"what is shutter speed in photography?\" and \"how does shutter speed affect a photo?\" enabling photographers to unlock new dimensions of photographic potential.BASIC CONCEPTS OF SHUTTER SPEEDEvery camera features a shutter, akin to a curtain, that opens and closes when the shutter button is pressed. This action exposes the camera's sensor to light for a duration known as the shutter speed, or exposure time. The control of this exposure time is pivotal in photography, as it influences both the brightness of the image and the visual effects that can be achieved.WHAT IS SHUTTER SPEED?Shutter speed refers to the length of time the camera’s shutter remains open to allow light onto the camera sensor. This duration is crucial as it determines how much light reaches the sensor, impacting the exposure and appearance of the final image. Fast shutter speeds help freeze motion, capturing sharp images of fast-moving subjects like sports and wildlife. Conversely, slow shutter speeds allow more light to enter, which can create blur motion effects in moving subjects, ideal for artistic shots of waterfalls or bustling city streets.WHAT IS SHUTTER SPEED?Shutter speed is how long the sensor collects the metered light. It controls motion rendering—either freezing action or showing deliberate blur. Faster speeds collect quickly; slower speeds collect slowly. * Fast (1/500s–1/4000s): Freeze people, sport, birds-in-flight. * Medium (1/60s–1/250s): Everyday movement with care for shake. * Slow (1/2s–30s): Creative blur—water, light trails, night scenes (tripod).MEASUREMENT UNITS FOR CAMERA SHUTTER SPEEDShutter speed is typically measured in seconds or fractions of a second, depending on the speed. Common fractions include 1/4 (a quarter of a second) and 1/250 (one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of a second). For extremely quick actions, shutter speeds can be as fast as 1/4000th to 1/8000th of a second, capturing moments imperceptible to the human eye. On the opposite spectrum, long exposures up to 30 seconds are used to photograph low-light scenes or create effects like light trails and smooth water surfaces in night landscapes.Understanding these basics allows photographers to manipulate shutter speed effectively, balancing light intake and motion blur to enhance their creative expression in photography.QUICK REFERENCE — TYPICAL SHUTTER SPEEDSSubject Speed Notes Portraits d smooth water surfaces in night landscapes.Understanding these basics allows photographers to manipulate shutter speed effectively, balancing light intake and motion blur to enhance their creative expression in photography.QUICK REFERENCE — TYPICAL SHUTTER SPEEDSSubject Speed Notes Portraits (posed)1/125–1/250sWatch blink & sway; IBIS helps.

This exposure time is crucial in determining both the brightness of the image and the clarity or artistic blur of moving subjects.EFFECTS ON MOTION BLURThe choice of shutter speed can either freeze action or allow motion blur, providing photographers with a powerful tool to enhance their creative expression. Fast shutter speeds, such as 1/250 second or faster, are ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects like athletes or wildlife, producing images that are crisp and clear with minimal motion blur. This capability to freeze moments in time is invaluable in sports and action photography, where clarity and detail are paramount.Conversely, slower shutter speeds, such as 1/60 second or slower, introduce motion blur, which can be used to artistic effect. This technique is often employed to capture the smooth flow of water or the bustling movement of city streets. However, to achieve sharp photos with slow shutter speeds, photographers should use a tripod or image stabilization technologies to counteract camera shake.EFFECTS ON LIGHT EXPOSUREShutter speed also significantly affects the exposure of a photograph. Fast shutter speeds reduce the amount of light that enters the camera, which can be beneficial in brightly lit conditions to avoid overexposure. On sunny days, a quick shutter speed ensures that photographs are not washed out. In contrast, in low-light situations, such as during the evening or in dimly lit interiors, slower shutter speeds are necessary to capture more light and prevent underexposed, dark photos.Understanding the interplay of shutter speed with aperture and ISO is essential for photographers to control the exposure triangle effectively. This balance ensures that the camera captures images with the desired brightness, using the appropriate combination of settings for any lighting condition.SELECTING THE RIGHT SHUTTER SPEED - WHAT IS SHUTTER SPEEDSelecting the appropriate shutter speed is crucial for achieving the desired photographic effect, whether it's freezing a moment in time or capturing the flow of movement. This section explores scenarios for low and high shutter speeds and the factors influencing these choices.✓ DO * Set shutter for intent first; then adjust aperture/ISO crucial for achieving the desired photographic effect, whether it's freezing a moment in time or capturing the flow of movement. This section explores scenarios for low and high shutter speeds and the factors influencing these choices.✓ DO * Set shutter for intent first; then adjust aperture/ISO to keep the meter reading. * Use AF-C + burst for action; pre-focus where the subject will be. * Stabilise: brace or tripod; use panning mode for lateral motion.✗ DON’T * Let speeds drift below a safe limit hand-held—raise ISO or widen aperture. * Rely on IS to freeze subjects—IS cures shake, not subject motion. * Judge exposure from LCD brightness—use histogram & highlight blinkies.LOW SHUTTER SPEED SCENARIOSLow shutter speeds, typically slower than 1/60 second, are ideal for creating motion blur and capturing low-light environments . They allow more light to hit the sensor, making them perfect for night photography or capturing movement in a creative way. For instance, shutter speeds ranging from 1-3 seconds can smooth out moving water, creating a silky effect on waterfalls. When photographing the night sky, settings between 21-30 seconds help capture stars clearly. It's important to use a tripod to stabilise the camera in these situations to prevent unwanted blur.HIGH SHUTTER SPEED SCENARIOSHigh shutter speeds, such as 1/500 second or faster, are essential for freezing fast-moving subjects. This setting is particularly useful in sports and wildlife photography, where capturing crisp, clear images of dynamic action is crucial. For example, shutter speeds of 1/2000 second are recommended for capturing birds in flight, while 1/1000 second can effectively freeze intense sports action. In brightly lit conditions, faster shutter speeds help avoid overexposure, maintaining the color and detail of the scene.FACTORS INFLUENCING CHOICESeveral factors influence the choice of shutter speed, including lighting conditions, subject movement, and desired visual effects. The focal length of the lens also plays a critical role; for handheld shooting, a good rule of thumb is to set the shutter speed at least equal to the lens's focal length to avoid camera shake. For more stability, some photographers use \"Brent's Shutter Speed Rule,\" which suggests doubling the shutter speed relative to the focal length. Additionally, when high-speed sync is necessary, such as in high-speed photography, the synchronization of the camera's shutter with a flash burst ensures proper exposure across the entire frame.TIPS FOR MASTERING SHUTTER SPEED - WHAT IS SHUTTER SPEEDMASTER SHUTTER SPEED IN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHYDownload the 1-page field checklist for freeze, blur and safe handheld speeds.Master Shutter Speed in Your Photography (PDF) Image Reviews Clinic (Zoom, £29) 1-to-1 Zoom Help Prefer a text link? Download the checklist here 1-to-1 Zoom Help Prefer a text link? Download the checklist here PRACTICING WITH DIFFERENT SPEEDSTo enhance your proficiency in using shutter speed effectively, it’s crucial to practice with various speeds across different scenarios. Begin by experimenting with fast shutter speeds such as 1/4000th of a second to capture quick-moving subjects like racing cars or birds in flight. This practice helps in understanding, “What Is Shutter Speed”, and how fast speeds can freeze motion, providing crisp, clear images. Conversely, explore slow shutter speeds from two to 30 seconds to observe the artistic blur effects on moving objects such as waterfalls or clouds. This range allows photographers to see how extended exposure times affect motion blur and light intake, creating ethereal and soft imagery.EDITING TIPS — WORKING WITH SHUTTER CHOICES * Subject blur can’t be fixed: sharpening won’t rescue motion-blurred subjects—get the speed right at capture. * Selective sharpening: deconvolution on static detail only; mask edges to avoid halos. * Enhance panning: add gentle motion blur to the background only; protect the subject with a tight mask. * Stack for cleaner night shots: align + average bursts for noise reduction on static scenes. * Mind highlight detail: pull highlights before clarity/texture to avoid crunchy halos on water or light trails.USING A TRIPODA tripod is an essential tool for mastering shutter speed, especially when working with slower speeds. It stabilises the camera, preventing unwanted blur from camera shake—a common issue when the shutter is open for longer periods. For sharp images in low-light conditions or when capturing the smooth motion of water and night skies, securing your camera on a tripod is indispensable. It not only helps in achieving clearer images but also allows for more deliberate and precise composition adjustments.EXPERIMENTING WITH VARIOUS SETTINGSMastering shutter speed also involves understanding the interplay with other camera settings like ISO and aperture. Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode to control the shutter speed directly while the camera adjusts the aperture for correct exposure. This setting is particularly useful for learning how changes in shutter speed affect exposure and image quality. Additionally, experiment with Manual mode to gain full control over all settings, giving you the flexibility to create perfectly balanced photos according to your artistic vision. In scenarios requiring precise timing and exposure, such as capturing star trails or fast-moving sports, these practices are invaluable.Engaging in these practices not only enhances technical skills but also encourages creative expression through varied photographic effects.INTERACTIVE: EXPOSURE CALCULATOROpen full screen [https://alanranger.github.io/exposure-calculator/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=exposure-calc",

Understanding what is negative space in photography and how to use it plays a crucial role in this art, offering a powerful tool to enhance visual impact and convey meaning. This concept, often associated with simplicity and minimalism, involves strategically using empty areas within a frame to emphasise the main subject and create a sense of balance and contrast in photography .Photographers who understand and utilise negative space can transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary compositions.

This article will explore the definition of negative space, its importance in photographic composition, and techniques to effectively incorporate it into images. By learning to harness the power of empty space, photographers can create more compelling focal points, isolate subjects, and evoke emotions through their work. Understanding this fundamental principle is essential to developing one's photographic skills and creating visually striking images with strong contrast meaning in photography.QUICK TIPS — USING NEGATIVE SPACE * Remove distractions: Strip out clutter; let your subject breathe. * Control mood: Wide empty space equals calm; tight framing equals tension. * Frame for simplicity: Use one subject, plenty of space, and keep horizons clean. * Balance with emptiness: Negative space can visually counterbalance a small, powerful subject.DEFINING NEGATIVE SPACE IN PHOTOGRAPHYWHAT IS NEGATIVE SPACE?Negative space in photography refers to the area surrounding the main subject in an image that is left unoccupied. It's the empty space that helps define the positive space, which is the main focus of the photograph. This concept plays a crucial role in composition, allowing photographers to create visually compelling contrast photos that draw the viewer's attention to the intended subject.Negative space acts as a buffer, providing breathing room for the eyes and enhancing the overall impact of the contrast photography. It's not merely about empty areas; it's about strategically using these spaces to communicate the composition effectively. When used creatively, negative space can evoke strong emotions, portray a sense of scale, and create exciting forms and illusions.View fullsizeQUICK TIPS — POSITIVE VS NEGATIVE SPACEBALANCE THE SPACES * Positive space: your subject or focal point. * Negative space: the area around it, providing contrast and mood. * Use the interplay to create hierarchy and guide the viewer’s eye. * Rule of thumb: let negative space occupy ~60% of the frame.WAYS TO USE NEGATIVE SPACE * Minimalism: isolate a small subject in emptiness (e.g., a dragonfly in sky). * Urban: city landmarks against large areas of darkness or plain walls. * Nature: vast skies, deserts, or fields for scale and freedom. * Depth of field: blur backgrounds into soft negative space. * Architecture: highlight shapes against clean skies or surfaces.Look for empty areas—sky, walls, water, sand—that can amplify your subject. Negative space isn’t absence; it’s a design element that defines mood and meaning.POSITIVE SPACE VS. NEGATIVE SPACETo understand negative space fully, it's essential to grasp its relationship with positive space. Positive space represents the main subject or focal point of the image, while negative space is the area surrounding it. The interplay between these two elements is crucial in creating a balanced and visually appealing composition with strong photography contrast.A simple analogy to understand this concept is writing on a page. The words that pop out at us represent the positive space, while the background of the page constitutes the negative space. In photography, this relationship is equally important, if not more so, as it provides a starting point for capturing simple yet effective pictures.The balance between page. The words that pop out at us represent the positive space, while the background of the page constitutes the negative space. In photography, this relationship is equally important, if not more so, as it provides a starting point for capturing simple yet effective pictures.The balance between positive and negative space creates a hierarchy of importance within the image. Effective photographers use this balance to guide the viewer's eye through the composition, telling their story in the most compelling way possible. In many cases, the strength of a subject is directly related to the negative space surrounding it, creating high contrast photography or low contrast photography depending on the desired effect.EXAMPLES OF NEGATIVE SPACE 1. Minimalist compositions : A photograph of a single dragonfly perched on a plant stem, surrounded by a vast, empty background, exemplifies the use of negative space. The emptiness around the subject draws attention to the dragonfly and the plant, creating a striking minimalist image with a clear minimalist definition photography. 2. Urban landscapes: An image of the Eiffel Tower at night, where more than half of the photograph is darkness, demonstrates effective use of negative space. The tower, spotlight, and city lights become the focal points. At the same time, the surrounding darkness acts as negative space, enhancing the overall mood of the picture and showcasing the definition of negative space photography. 3. Natural environments: Photographs featuring subjects against expansive skies, vast deserts, or wide fields of grass utilise natural elements as negative space. These images often convey a sense of scale, isolation, or freedom, answering what negative space means in photography. 4. Depth of field: By using a large aperture setting, photographers can create a shallow depth of field, blurring the background and effectively turning it into negative space. This technique helps eliminate distractions and isolate the subject, creating an image maximising the negative space. 5. Architectural shots: Photographs of buildings or structures against a clear sky or a plain wall can create striking contrasting photography where the empty space accentuates the architectural elements.Photographers can find negative space by looking for empty areas in their surroundings. The sky, blank walls, or even textured surfaces like grass or sand can serve as effective negative space when used thoughtfully to create a compelling photos. The key is to be creative and recognise the potential for negative space in various environments.To achieve the right effect, a good rule of thumb is to allow negative space to occupy at least 60% of the photograph. This balance helps create impactful images where the space itself becomes a crucial element of the composition, often stealing the show and defining the photograph's mood and message, as seen in the works of renowned photographers.View fullsizeView fullsizeTHE IMPORTANCE OF NEGATIVE SPACEQUICK TIPS — IMPORTANCE OF NEGATIVE SPACEBALANCE & HARMONY * Distribute subject + empty space thoughtfully for stability. * Offset visual weight with tone, colour, or texture in the background. * Try symmetry or asymmetry to find the most pleasing balance. * Use space as “rest areas” so the viewer’s eye moves smoothly.EMPHASISE THE SUBJECT * Create contrast between subject and surroundings (light/dark, colour, . * Offset visual weight with tone, colour, or texture in the background. * Try symmetry or asymmetry to find the most pleasing balance. * Use space as “rest areas” so the viewer’s eye moves smoothly.EMPHASISE THE SUBJECT * Create contrast between subject and surroundings (light/dark, colour, focus). * Simplify backgrounds — remove clutter, edit distractions out. * Frame naturally with windows, arches, branches, or blurred edges. * Leave “breathing room” around the subject to amplify importance.EVOKING EMOTION * Scale: Small subject + vast space = isolation, vulnerability, or awe. * Colour psychology: Warm tones uplift; cool or dark tones suggest solitude. * Light & shadow: Use high-key for airiness; low-key for drama or melancholy. * Experiment: Test different space ratios until the mood feels right.Negative space plays a crucial role in photography, offering a powerful tool to enhance visual impact and convey meaning. It refers to the areas in a photograph that are not occupied by the main subject, providing context, balance, and contrasting colours within the composition.CREATING BALANCE AND HARMONYNegative space has an essential function in achieving visual balance and harmony within a composition. A well-balanced photograph is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to look at, as it provides visual stability. Negative space helps to achieve this balance by distributing visual weight evenly across the frame, much like the principles of the colour wheel .When a photograph is too crowded with elements, it can feel chaotic and overwhelming. Negative space counteracts this by providing areas of rest, allowing the viewer's eye to move smoothly across the image. This balance between positive and negative space creates a harmonious composition that is both engaging and relaxing.To create balance using negative space, photographers should consider the following: 1. Distribution of elements: Ensure that the subject and the surrounding empty space are thoughtfully arranged, taking into account texture and complementary colours. 2. Visual weight: Use negative space to offset the weight of the main subject, applying principles of colour theory. 3. Symmetry or asymmetry: Experiment with different compositions to find the most pleasing balance, using warm colours or cool tones.EMPHASISING THE SUBJECTNegative space acts as a powerful tool to enhance the main subject of a photograph, whether in portrait photography, low-key images, or landscapes featuring cool colours. By isolating the subject against a minimalistic background, photographers draw attention to its details and bring it into the spotlight. The absence of distractions allows viewers to appreciate the subject's beauty and intricacies even more.To emphasise the subject using negative space: 1. Create contrast: Use a stark difference between the subject and its surroundings, whether in street photography or nature photography. 2. Simplify the background: Remove any elements that might compete for attention, using editing software if necessary. 3. Use framing techniques: Employ natural frames within the scene to direct focus, experimenting with aperture to blur the background .Negative space provides breathing room for the subject, preventing the image from feeling cluttered or overwhelming. This technique not only enhances the subject's prominence but also evokes emotion to direct focus, experimenting with aperture to blur the background .Negative space provides breathing room for the subject, preventing the image from feeling cluttered or overwhelming. This technique not only enhances the subject's prominence but also evokes emotional responses, leading to more engaging and thought-provoking photographs, whether in high-key or low-key styles.EVOKING EMOTIONSNegative space greatly impacts the mood and story of an image, whether in the final photograph or during post-production. By manipulating light and shadows and colour contrast, it can create or enhance emotions, such as lightness, airiness, positivity, or the feelings of the subject. However, it can also evoke loneliness or despair. The use of negative space affects the photographer's message, emotions, and storytelling. When used correctly, it emphasises these aspects; when misused, it has the opposite effect.To evoke emotions using negative space: 1. Consider the scale: A small subject surrounded by vast empty space can create feelings of isolation or vulnerability, showcasing the dynamic range of the scene. 2. Use colour psychology: The colour of the negative space can influence the emotional impact, so consider using contrasting colours to ensure the subject stands out. 3. Experiment with different compositions: Try various arrangements to find the most emotionally resonant image, whether high contrast or low contrast.Town & CountryBy understanding and applying the principles of negative space, photographers can enhance their visual storytelling and produce more compelling and emotionally resonant images. Whether it's to illustrate vastness, isolate subjects, or bring order to chaotic compositions, negative space serves as a powerful tool in the photographer's arsenal, enabling them to craft images that speak volumes through simplicity and balance while adding visual interest.TECHNIQUES FOR USING NEGATIVE SPACEQUICK TIPS — TECHNIQUES FOR USING NEGATIVE SPACEFRAMING & COMPOSITION * Step back to include more surroundings and emphasise space. * Use the rule of thirds — place the subject off-centre for impact. * Experiment with angles/perspectives to add depth and flow. * Balance positive + negative space for stability and calm. * Let empty areas guide the eye naturally toward the subject.USING LIGHT & SHADOW * Change lighting angles (front, side, back) to sculpt shadows. * Use hard light for bold contrast and defined forms. * Use soft light for subtle separation and gentle space. * Try black & white — strip colour to emphasise tone/texture. * Shadows themselves can act as negative space to frame subjects.FRAMING AND COMPOSITIONNegative space plays a crucial role in framing and composing photographs. Photographers can use this technique to create visually striking images that draw the viewer's attention to the main subject. When composing a shot, it's essential to consider the rule of thirds, which suggests placing the main subject off-centre for a more engaging composition that highlights the interplay between highlights and shadows.To effectively use negative space in framing: 1. Step back from the subject to include more of the surrounding environment, emphasising tonal contrast . 2. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to find the most compelling composition that adds depth and dimension. 3. Use the empty spac",

Sensor dust is a formidable foe, frequently responsible for those irritating dark spots that spoil your photos, particularly when shooting with narrow apertures or against vivid, high-contrast backgrounds. Mastering the use of a camera sensor cleaner not only enhances the quality of your images by improving contrast but also protects the core of your camera from the expensive risk of sensor replacement.As we embark on this journey together, I'll reveal why regular sensor maintenance—typically recommended biennially or quarterly, though sometimes more urgently when shooting regularly — is an indispensable part of your photography practice. We'll cover everything from the basic know-how of identifying when your sensor requires attention to mastering the cleaning process with suitable materials like cleaning swabs and fluids.Moreover, for those situations when professional help is needed, I'll guide you through finding reliable camera sensor cleaning services near you if you are not near me in Coventry. Not only that, but I'll also impart best practice ing process with suitable materials like cleaning swabs and fluids.Moreover, for those situations when professional help is needed, I'll guide you through finding reliable camera sensor cleaning services near you if you are not near me in Coventry. Not only that, but I'll also impart best practices that will help maintain your sensor's cleanliness long-term, such as the judicious handling of lens changes and tapping into the self-cleaning features available in modern digital SLRs.Whether you are a seasoned professional or a passionate enthusiast, harnessing techniques for cleaning your camera sensor will be a stepping stone to ensuring you keep our camera in top condition and extend its longevity. Let's delve into the world of camera sensor cleaning, where each step is an investment in the artistry and longevity of your photographic equipment.----------------------------------------WHAT ARE DUST SPOTS?In mastering the art of camera sensor cleaning, it's critical to recognise dust spots. These unwelcome guests can manifest as visible specks or smudges on your images, often ruining an otherwise flawless photograph. These dust spots tend to stand out when photographing large areas of consistent color, such as the tranquil blue of the sky or the delicate gradients of a sunrise, necessitating a thorough cleaning image process.View fullsize----------------------------------------HOW DOES DUST GET ONTO THE CAMERA SENSOR? * Environmental Factors: High dust areas or windy conditions can introduce more particles into the camera body, especially during lens changes. Photographers working in such environments may need to clean more frequently. * Lens Changing Practices: Regularly alternating lenses can expose the sensor to the environment. When changing lenses, always aim the camera downward to minimize dust entry. Keeping this habit will lessen sensor cleaning occurrences. * Camera Type: With mirrorless cameras like the Sony A7 IV, the sensor is more exposed due to the shutter's position, meaning you may encounter more dust than with a DSLR. * Frequency of Use: The more extensively you use your camera, the more it's exposed to potential contaminants. * Personal Sensitivity to Dust: Some photographers are more affected by the smallest specks, whereas others may not find them as distracting, adjusting their cleaning intervals accordingly. * Origins of Dust Spots: Your camera sensor can collect dust and debris from various sources. When you detach a lens, minute particles from the environment seize the opportunity to settle on the sensor. Even the regular operation of your camera's internal mechanisms, like zooming a lens, can contribute to this issue as it can dislodge oil or other minute particles onto the sensitive surface. * Dust doesn't land on the sensor but on a low-pass filter in front, acting as a protective barrier. This is a relief because it's a less delicate area to clean. * Visibility in Photos: Apertures play a crucial role here. When you stop down to smaller apertures (F8 or higher), commonly used in landscape photography, dust spots become more pronounced. These are the settings where we aspire for a sharp focus across a broad depth of field, yet sensor dust can potentially compromise the image clarity we strive for.THE IMPLICATIONS OF NEGLECT: IGNORING THESE PARTICLES CAN HAVE CASCADING EFFECTS ON YOUR GEAR: * Accumulated dust can necessitate more frequent cleanings, heightening the risk of in p focus across a broad depth of field, yet sensor dust can potentially compromise the image clarity we strive for.THE IMPLICATIONS OF NEGLECT: IGNORING THESE PARTICLES CAN HAVE CASCADING EFFECTS ON YOUR GEAR: * Accumulated dust can necessitate more frequent cleanings, heightening the risk of inadvertently damaging your camera's inner workings. * Left unchecked, dust can embed itself on the sensor, risking permanent damage and impacting image quality. * Dust spots can also challenge your camera's autofocus, slowing it down or causing it to focus inaccurately, adding undue frustration to your photography sessions, especially in dim lighting conditions.----------------------------------------HERE'S A QUICK TECHNIQUE TO SPOT THEM:Recognising the Telltale Signs of Sensor Dust: * Consistent Spotting: If you notice that dark spots persist in the same locations across various images—even after switching lenses—it strongly indicates that these culprits reside on your camera sensor and not on your lenses. * Aperture’s Role: The size and contrast of these dark spots can fluctuate with changing apertures; they become especially pronounced and bothersome in images taken with smaller apertures. F8 - F22Do a dust spot check regularly.----------------------------------------HOW TO CHECK FOR SENSOR DUST:CAPTURE A TEST IMAGE:1. Select a clear blue sky or a plain white wall or ceiling as your subject to ensure uniformity in the background.2. Set your camera to a narrow aperture, such as F/16 or F22, to make any dust particles more visible.3. Focus to infinity, or if indoors, set your lens to manual focus and defocus it to make the wall appear smooth.INSPECT THE IMAGE:4. Take a test shot and transfer the image to your computer for a closer inspection, magnifying the picture to spot any inconsistencies.5. Look for grey dots that denote the presence of sensor dust, being aware that these spots will persist in all your images in the same location.6. If you have Adobe Lightroom Classic installed on your laptop or desktop, use the Spot Removal Tool (named “Healing” in LRC13) and toggle the “Visualise Mask” tool on. This will invert the background to black and show dust stops in white.7. Use the camera Self-cleaning Mode: Many cameras come equipped with a self-cleaning sensor function—a convenient first step before attempting any hands-on cleaning. Use this function first and then repeat steps 1 to 6.View fullsizevisualise dust spots in LRC----------------------------------------PREPARING FOR THE SENSOR CLEANING PROCEDURE:Professional Services: If the self-cleaning mode and rocket blower don't fully remove the dust, or if you prefer professional service, search for 'camera cleaning service near me'. Professional cleaning ensures the best care for your camera sensor by experts adept in 'how to clean camera sensor' using specialised tools and techniques. There are several high street camera equipment companies, like WEX, Jessops and LCE who can offer you a camera sensor clean near you. It will depend on where you are located and their turnaround time and cost for the service if it matches your needs.PREPARATION FOR DOING A SENSOR CLEAN YOURSELF OR TAKING IT TO A PROFESSIONAL CLEANING SERVICE. 1. Ideal Cleaning Workspace: Seek a clean, dust-free area to perform sensor cleaning.

Ideal Cleaning Workspace: Seek a clean, dust-free area to perform sensor cleaning. Gather your essential tools like sensor swabs and camera sensor cleaning fluid, designed specifically for this delicate process. 2. Fully Charged Battery: Always start with a full battery to prevent the camera from shutting off during the cleaning process. A camera suddenly powering down could damage the sensor or other internal elements. 3. Lens and Memory Card attached: You may need to take multiple shots before and after each clean to determine spot removal.ASSEMBLE YOUR CLEANING TOOLKIT: * CAMERA SENSOR CLEANING SWABS: These are designed to gently remove any dust or smudges without damaging the sensitive sensor. * Size and Shape: Sensor cleaning swabs are designed to match the dimensions of the camera's sensor, ensuring precise and thorough cleaning. * Material: They are usually made from lint-free, non-abrasive materials to prevent scratching or damaging the sensor surface. * Absorbency: The swabs are designed to effectively absorb and lift away dust and particles without leaving behind residue or streaks. * Compatibility: They are available in various sizes to accommodate different sensor sizes and formats, such as full-frame, APS-C, or micro four-thirds sensors. * SENSOR CLEANING SOLUTION: Sensor cleaning solutions typically consist of: * Surfactants: These are the active cleaning agents that help to break down and remove the dirt and grime from the sensor surface. * Deionized Water: Often used as a solvent to dissolve and remove any remaining residue. * Isopropyl Alcohol: Sometimes included to aid in the evaporation of the cleaning solution and to ensure a streak-free finish. * Anti-Static Agents: These help to reduce the buildup of static electricity, which can attract dust particles. * VIBRATING SENSOR SWAB TOOL: The vibrating sensor swab tool typically features the following characteristics: * Vibration Mechanism: The tool is equipped with a mechanism that generates gentle vibrations transmitted to the sensor cleaning swab during use. * Battery-Powered: It is often battery-powered, allowing for portable and convenient use in various settings. * Compatibility: The tool is designed to work with sensor cleaning swabs, allowing users to combine the benefits of vibration with the precision of swab-based cleaning. * Ease of Use: The vibrating action aims to assist in dislodging and removing stubborn particles from the sensor, potentially improving the efficiency of the cleaning process. * NYLON SENSOR BRUSH: Nylon sensor brushes typically exhibit the following characteristics: * Soft Bristles: The brush features soft nylon bristles that are designed to be gentle on the sensor's surface, minimizing the risk of scratching or causing damage. * Anti-Static Properties: Many nylon sensor brushes are engineered to be anti-static, which helps reduce the likelihood of attracting additional dust particles during the cleaning process. * Ergonomic Handle: The brush is often designed with an ergonomic handle for comfortable and precise handling during use. * Compatibility: Nylon sensor brushes are available in various sizes to accommodate different sensor dimensions, such as full-frame, APS-C, or micro four-thirds sen * Ergonomic Handle: The brush is often designed with an ergonomic handle for comfortable and precise handling during use. * Compatibility: Nylon sensor brushes are available in various sizes to accommodate different sensor dimensions, such as full-frame, APS-C, or micro four-thirds sensors. * AIR BLOWER: This tool is essential for the initial dust removal. Use it to blow off any loose dust without making direct contact with the sensor. The sensor air blower typically possesses the following features and functionality: * Handheld Design: It is designed to be handheld, often resembling a squeeze bulb or a syringe, allowing for precise control and application of air. * Focused Air Stream: The blower emits a focused stream of air, enabling targeted cleaning of the sensor and other camera components. * Non-Contact Cleaning: As a non-contact cleaning tool, the air blower minimizes the risk of direct physical contact with the sensor, reducing the potential for damage. * Anti-Static Properties: Many air blowers are constructed to be anti-static, helping to mitigate the attraction of additional dust particles during the cleaning process. Replace your air blower every 18 months. I have experienced a blower doing more harm than good by blowing more dust and even perished rubber particles from inside the blower onto the sensor. * HEAD LAMP OR SENSOR LOUPE: A magnifying glass with a light source like the Carson SensorMag is handy for spotting the tiniest specks of dirt, especially on mirrorless cameras' sensors. A headlamp or sensor loupe for a well-lit, magnified sensor view. The sensor loupe typically possesses the following features and functionality: * Magnification: It provides significant magnification, often in the range of 5x to 7x, enabling close scrutiny of the sensor surface to identify even the smallest particles or imperfections. * Uniform Illumination: Many sensor loupes incorporate built-in LED illumination to ensure uniform and adequate lighting for thorough sensor inspection. * Adjustable Focus: Some models feature adjustable focus to fine-tune the magnified view of the sensor for precise examination.When it's time for cleaning, opt for dedicated camera sensor cleaning kits. These kits are typically equipped with precision cleaning fluids and lintless swabs, which are designed to meticulously clean camera sensors without leaving any residue.And remember, regular Q-tips and standard lens cleaners can do more harm than good. Their fibres can deposit additional debris, compromising your camera sensor cleaning efforts.----------------------------------------MY CAMERA AND SENSOR CLEANING PRODUCT SHOPPING LIST: * Camera Sensor Cleaning Swabs: * Full Frame 24mm Sensor - Amazon * APS-C 16mm Sensor - Amazon * Sensor Cleaning Solution: * You can often get the sensor cleaning fluid as part of a package with swabs, but here is a link to what I use.

      "articleBody": "TOP TIPS FOR PHOTOGRAPHING BLUEBELLS | A PROFESSIONAL GUIDETable of Contents ShowBluebell woodlands are always an annual highlight for outdoor photographers and I am fortunate enough to have an arrangement with a local land-owner for access to a private woodland in Warwickshire. People are always suggesting public woods to me for photographing bluebells, and whilst I appreciate their intentions I have yet to see any of these public woods that match the private woodlands I run my workshops in. See details for my bluebell workshop dates at the end of this post.The woods are managed for game and therefore the woodland floor is generally less cluttered and cleared to maximise the views of dense bluebell carpets that are not trampled on by “ignorant” members of the public who think it’s ok to do a selfie in the middle of the bluebells and causing substantial damage to the natural habitat and future flowering.Therefore, my first tips for shooting bluebells wherever you go is:PHOTOGRAPHING BLUEBELLS----------------------------------------1. DO NOT TRAMPLE ON THE BLUEBELLS!> According to research carried out by Moulton College in the Midlands, once damaged, bluebells need approximately five years, without any additional disturbance, to recover fully. Not only does trampling cause a loss of up to 96% of the bluebells’ flowers, but the species also cannot produce seeds as efficiently, consequently affecting many generations to come.ht ds, once damaged, bluebells need approximately five years, without any additional disturbance, to recover fully. Not only does trampling cause a loss of up to 96% of the bluebells’ flowers, but the species also cannot produce seeds as efficiently, consequently affecting many generations to come.https://heartwoodforest.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/save-our-bluebells-2017/ If you see others trampling on them when photographing bluebells explain why that’s causing damage and how it can take up to five years for them to recover, if undisturbed again. Most woodlands have paths so stick to those and be mindful of your impact on the ecology of the woodlands.----------------------------------------2. GO EARLY OR LATE AND AVOID THE TOURISTS!As photographers, we are really passionate about getting those great shots of nature with beautiful light but non-photographers also have as much right to enjoy the bluebells too. If you want to avoid the “tourist” day-trippers then it pays to go very early in the day, as early as sunrise, or very late in the day as the sun sets. You will undoubtedly avoid the flocks of people that turn up between 10 am and 4 pm and hopefully, get some images without every person and their dog in the frame.The National Trust, as an example, have introduced a charge in certain woodlands to try and reduce the volume of traffic to well-known bluebell woodland sites on its estates.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/18/national-trust-charges-to-see-bluebell-woods-after-crowds-trampl/ ----------------------------------------3. GO PREPARED WITH THE RIGHT GEARPhotographing bluebells can be done in many ways, more of that later, but essentials, in my view, are the following items to improve your chances of getting the best results. * A polariser filter - will help reduce the reflective glare of shiny and wet surfaces and increase the saturation and contrast in your shots - you need to purchase one that fits the diameter of your lens. See my post on filters for more information. * The choice of lenses is always a dilemma if worry about weight or have too many options/distractions in your kit bag. Personally, I prefer two lenses - 70-200mm and a macro lens. However, wide-angle lenses (16-35mm) are also useful in certain situations so if you do have a set that covers a range then it might be worth the weight of carrying them - just try to avoid the I’ve carried these so am going to use them regardless syndrome! Pick the right tool for the job. * At least one spare battery and memory card. You can never have enough batteries and a spare memory card will safeguard you against the unexpected corruption issue whilst there. * Tripods are beneficial for several reasons. * They allow you to frame and re-compose your shot easily with small adjustments to the composition * They stabilise your camera which will allow you to shoot at slower shutter speeds and still get sharp results - remember to turn off image stabilisation! * When doing macro and close-ups it’s essential to use a tripod if you want sharp/in-focus results with blurred backgrounds - the slightest movement in the subject or camera will result in out of focus images. * If you are panning or shoo lts - remember to turn off image stabilisation! * When doing macro and close-ups it’s essential to use a tripod if you want sharp/in-focus results with blurred backgrounds - the slightest movement in the subject or camera will result in out of focus images. * If you are panning or shooting a panoramic the tripod makes this technique much easier to produce the overall aligned shots with the scene being vertically and horizontally level. * My recommended tripods - tripods-gitzo-vs-benro-head-to-head * A remote release cable enables you to take the photo without touching the camera and potentially causing vibration and camera movement resulting in a slightly out of focus shot, If you don’t have a remote release cable then use the camera's built-in 2 sec or 10-sec timer function. * A kneeling mat or dustbin liner is great for doing those low down perspectives and macro shots. * Large sandwich bag or clear plastic bag to cover the camera in the event of rain. * Flask of tea/coffee and snacks – It will be cold early on if you are there at sunrise * Warm clothes – gloves/hat – it’s cold at sunrise in Apr/May! * Wellies or walking shoes/boots – dry warm feet help you stay focused * If you are a smoker then please take something with you to take cigarette butts away with you----------------------------------------4. GET THE COLOUR RIGHT. * White Balance calibration tool - I have lost count of the number of times I have seen bluebell photos that look anything but their natural colour. It’s true that bluebell colour will vary from purple-ish to hues of blue depending on the light temperature and time of day and weather situation. However, if you calibrate the light temperature using a custom white balance then you know that your images won’t need further correction when back home unless it’s for aesthetic/creative reasons. Doing a custom white balance only takes ten seconds but you need to remember to re-calibrate the custom white balance every hour or as often as you sense the light changes or your photos don’t reflect the colour your eye sees. A simple and cost-effective tool for this is the white balance lens cap filter. Make sure you purchase the right size for the diameter of your lens. Check your camera manual for how to set a custom white balance for your particular camera. If using a white balance preset, I recommend cloudy or shady not Auto White Balance (AWB) * Set your JPG Picture Style to Neutral – You should find this in the camera menu system and it will be called something like - Creative style or Picture Style - You are looking for the setting where there are three or four of the icons for contrast, saturation, sharpening all display as zero - meaning that the image recorded is not being artificially enhanced and the colour isn’t exa m and it will be called something like - Creative style or Picture Style - You are looking for the setting where there are three or four of the icons for contrast, saturation, sharpening all display as zero - meaning that the image recorded is not being artificially enhanced and the colour isn’t exaggerated fooling you into thinking your white balance is correct or incorrect.Even if you shoot in RAW only, remember the image displayed on the back of the cameras LCD is a jpg thumbnail so will show the jpg picture style settings. Your RAW file will not, of course, be affected by these settings.----------------------------------------5. GET THE EXPOSURE RIGHT. * Metering Modes – Changing metering modes may help you get an exposure that emphasises the light contrast so work out where to change it on your camera and choose centre-weighted average or spot metering mode to ensure your shadows and highlights have good exposure. It’s easy to check the exposure on the image you have just taken by reviewing the histogram of the image. - Check your camera manual on how to display the histogram for the photo your viewing. * Woodland lighting can be very contrasty and cause exposure issues if you use evaluative metering as the camera tries to deal with a dynamic range of light that exceeds the range the camera can record in a single exposure. Using graduated filters to reduce the bright areas can be tricky because you will effectively darken down tree trunks as well as sky. You can of course bracket exposures . but then you will also need to use the software on the computer to blend them together into a single frame. Personally, I prefer to spot meter and expose it to the right to protect the highlights and then adjust the shadows and mid-tones in post-process. * Personally, my style and preference are to frame the composition without sky leaking into the top of the frame, thus avoiding dynamic range exposure issues and giving as much exposure as the camera allows to the bluebells and dark shadows around them.----------------------------------------6. GET THE DOF RIGHT. * In my view the most common mistake (mistake is probably controversial) is that beginners believe that landscape photography is about getting every aspect of the frame in sharp focus and a depth of field that starts at 1 cm in front of the camera to infinity distance. And, when the camera doesn’t quite match that expectation they then give the image a dose of over-sharpening steroids or detail extractor in post-production. There is no right or wrong answer to this setting or treatment other than personal interpretation and taste. However, you have to consider how your eye sees the scene naturally and how far you wish to push those boundaries - is photography about reality (based on human perception and how the eye witnesses something) or is it about something that is an art form and therefore transcends those boundaries. The answer to that question is a personal one so I won’t make a judgement on either side of that argument but just say that you should knowingly set your depth of field (Aperture F stop) to create the illusion that matches your intention. * I have taken many bluebell woodland shots over the years and the DoF ranges from wide-open F2.8 to F6.3 with varying focal lengths to F16 but the majority of shots that match my style are generally in the lower DoF range because I want the “il to create the illusion that matches your intention. * I have taken many bluebell woodland shots over the years and the DoF ranges from wide-open F2.8 to F6.3 with varying focal lengths to F16 but the majority of shots that match my style are generally in the lower DoF range because I want the “illusion” of the dense patch of bluebells in the distance rather than attempting to show every bluebell within 200 meters in front of me as sharp as the next. So, when photographing bluebells be open-minded about using various apertures and focus points to experiment.----------------------------------------7. VARY YOUR HEIGHT, POSITION AND ANGLE. * Think about your viewpoint and elevation to the subject when photographing bluebells * Survey your subject from many viewpoints and perspectives * Take note of the light, contrasts, surroundings and background - photograph the light! * Watch out for cluttered backgrounds and distractions I have witnessed a bad habit over the years ( I am guilty too sometimes) of putting the camera on the tripod, at any given height, and then simply moving the tripod to the next spot and framing a shot without first evaluating a different height, position and angle to my subject. It’s an easy trap to fall into so try to remember to treat every shot with the same care and duty that you gave the first shot you made that day.Take a look at my composition viewing frames to help you work this out----------------------------------------8. DESIGN YOUR COMPOSITION.Composition is key – make sure it has a good skeleton framework of interest * Decide on a clear subject, focal point and framing when photographing bluebells * Watch out for intruders (distractions) on edge of the frame and very dark or very light areas inside the frame. * The edges/border of the image are just as important as what’s inside so keep them simple/clean and as consistent as possible * Think about movement, and dynamism in the composition so there are strong directional flows and contrasts of light and dark that support this. * You don’t have to show the whole area/environment, get closer for details * Aperture variation can produce vastly different results of blurred or detailed backgrounds so experiment but don’t just stick to one F number! * Look for texture, shape, form, interesting angles and use lines wisely * Think about changing aspect ratios of the frame in the camera to help you frame a better composition.----------------------------------------9. CREATIVITY AND EXPERIMENTATION.It can become lazy to just move around a location and apply the same style, technique and method. This approach limits and stifles your creativity. Try and remind yourself about the endless ways you can approach photographing bluebells and situations and be open to experimentation. Even if it fails it will broaden your creative thinking for the future. * Think about the many techniques, styles and subjects you can try and apply when photographing bluebells: * Abstract, Macro, Straight, Close-Up, Movement, High Key, Low Key, Vista, Long Exposure, ICM, Minimalist, HDR… * Consider taking a vertical and horizontal composition for every subject/shot, sometimes it produces surprising results.----------------------------------------10.

At its essence, this genre captures the inherent beauty of the natural world, striving to convey a sense of scale, majesty, and awe that transports the viewer right into the scene.Connecting deeply with the environment, landscape photographers become storytellers, immortalising moments of beauty in natural landscapes through their lenses without altering the reality of the scenes before them. It's a discipline that has evolved significantly since Nicéphore Niépce captured the first landscape photograph in 1827, showing us how deeply integrated and significant landscape photography is in the history and future of photography.Niépce took the first-ever photograph in 1826 or 1827 from an upstairs window of his estate in Saint-Lop-de-Varenees, Burgundy, France, using a camera obscura and a bitumen-coated pewter plate. He exposed it for several hours.View fullsizeJoseph Nicéphore Niépce took the world's first photograph in 1826 with the first proper camera. Niépce took the photograph from the upstairs windows of his Burgundy estate.Embarking on a landscape photography venture allows photographers to explore the nuances of natural landscapes, whether capturing the serene beauty of a cityscape under the twilight sky or the intricate patterns of astrophotography.With advancements in technology, the array of equipment available—from drones capturing breathtaking aerial landscape pictures to underwater setups revealing the mysteries beneath the water's surface—has transformed how we approach and appreciate landscape images. Tailored for passionate photographers focusing on the United Kingdom landscape photography market, this article will provide essential tips for landscape photography and techniques, from mastering camera settings for long exposure photography to choosing the right gear and implementing advanced strategies. Get ready to dive into landscape photography workshops that promise to enrich your skill set and inspire you to capture beautiful landscape pictures.----------------------------------------UNDERSTANDING LIGHTQUICK TIPS — LIGHT & TIMING * Golden hour: Warm, low sun adds texture and depth. * Blue hour: Balanced sky and ambient glow for subtle colour. * Midday: Use strong shadows and contrasts graphically. * Look for side light to carve relief; backlight for silhouettes or rim glow. * Watch the forecast — clouds, mist, and storms add drama.In the realm of landscape photography, mastering the nuances of light is crucial for capturing the essence of the natural landscapes across the United Kingdom. Light not only illuminates the scene but also shapes the mood and emotion conveyed through each photograph. Here are some key aspects of light that every photographer should understand:QUALITY AND DIRECTION OF LIGHT 1. Soft Light: Predominantly found during ov dscapes across the United Kingdom. Light not only illuminates the scene but also shapes the mood and emotion conveyed through each photograph. Here are some key aspects of light that every photographer should understand:QUALITY AND DIRECTION OF LIGHT 1. Soft Light: Predominantly found during overcast days or in open shade, soft light minimises shadows and helps achieve saturated colours, perfect for capturing the subtle tones of a misty British morning. 2. Hard Light: Occurs during bright sunny days, producing deep contrasts and pronounced shadows. This type of light is ideal for highlighting the rugged textures of natural landscapes like the Scottish Highlands. 3. Directional Light: The angle of light, whether it's the golden hues of morning and evening or the harsh midday sun, dramatically affects the visual impact of the landscape. Side lighting can enhance the texture and depth, while backlight can create ethereal silhouettes and highlight fine details such as morning dew on foliage.SPECIAL LIGHTING CONDITIONS * Backlight and Golden Hours: These are magical times for photographers, especially during the golden hours shortly after sunrise and before sunset. The soft and warm light paints the landscape in vibrant colours, enhancing the visual drama of places like the Lake District or the rolling hills of the Cotswolds. * Twilight and Dappled Light: The serene twilight provides pastel blues and pinks, ideal for capturing peaceful scenes with a tranquil mood. Meanwhile, dappled light through clouds or tree canopies can add a playful element to woodland areas, creating a mosaic of light and shadow.REFLECTIVE AND HUMAN-MADE LIGHT * Reflected Light: Often overlooked, light reflecting off surfaces like water, sand, or even buildings can illuminate subjects indirectly, offering a softer alternative to direct sunlight. In the UK, where water bodies and wet surfaces are common, reflected light can transform a scene into a luminous composition. * Human-Made Light: Incorporating elements like city lights or creatively using light trails can add a unique perspective to landscape photos, especially during the blue hour when natural and artificial lights balance each other.Understanding and harnessing these different types of light will enhance photographers' technical skills and expand their creative horizons, enabling them to tell more compelling stories through their captures of the UK's diverse landscapes.----------------------------------------MASTERING COMPOSITIONQUICK TIPS — COMPOSE WITH INTENT * Anchor your image with a strong focal point. * Use foreground interest and leading lines to create depth. * Apply rule of thirds or symmetry depending on subject mood. * Check your edges—avoid cut elements that distract. * Include scale (people, trees, objects) to emphasise vastness.In landscape photography, the art of composition transcends mere placement of elements within a frame; it involves a deliberate orchestration that guides the viewer's eye and evokes emotion. For the aspiring photographers focused on the picturesque landscapes of the United Kingdom, mastering composition is essential for capturing the essence of its diverse natural beauty.THE RULE OF THIRDS AND BEYONDThe rule of thirds is foundational in photographic composition, suggesting that the main points of interest should align with the gridlines or their intersections on your camera’s display. For instance, positioning the horizon a essence of its diverse natural beauty.THE RULE OF THIRDS AND BEYONDThe rule of thirds is foundational in photographic composition, suggesting that the main points of interest should align with the gridlines or their intersections on your camera’s display. For instance, positioning the horizon along the top third line, with a captivating castle or a lone tree near the left or right intersection, can create a balanced yet dynamic image. However, the golden ratio and the golden triangle offer alternative frameworks that might suit the rolling hills of the Cotswolds or the rugged coastlines of Devon even better, providing a more natural aesthetic flow that leads the viewer's eye through the scene.STRATEGIC PLACEMENT OF FOCAL POINTSIdentifying and emphasising focal points is crucial in telling a story through your image. In the UK’s landscapes, whether it’s the dramatic Dover cliffs or the Lake District's serene lakes, placing these elements strategically within your frame can anchor the viewer’s attention. Techniques like getting low to capture detailed textures of the foreground or using natural lines—such as a row of colourful wildflowers or a winding track—to lead to these focal points enhance the depth and interest of the composition.EXPLORING PERSPECTIVES AND ANGLESBefore you settle your tripod, please take a moment to explore different perspectives by walking around the scene. This practice not only reveals unexpected and less clichéd compositions but also helps in understanding how various elements like light, shadow, and texture can interplay creatively. Considering different aspect ratios and orientations—whether a sweeping horizontal view for a majestic sunrise or a vertical frame to capture the towering height of a mountain—adds versatility to your photographic narrative, making each shot uniquely impactful.By integrating these composition strategies, photographers can transform simple landscape shots into compelling visual stories that resonate with viewers, encouraging a deeper appreciation for the natural landscapes of the United Kingdom.----------------------------------------CHOOSING THE RIGHT GEARQUICK TIPS — ESSENTIAL GEAR * Use a sturdy tripod for long exposures and sharp detail. * Wide-angle lenses for sweeping vistas; telephotos for isolating layers. * Carry ND filters for long exposures; polariser for reflections/sky. * Spare batteries, rain cover, and microfiber cloth are field essentials. * Shoot RAW at base ISO for max flexibility in post.In the quest to capture the quintessential British landscape, selecting the right gear is paramount. For enthusiasts venturing into the diverse terrains of the United Kingdom, from the rugged Scottish Highlands to the serene lakes of the Lake District, here’s a strategic guide to assembling your landscape photography toolkit:ESSENTIAL CAMERA EQUIPMENT 1. Camera Body: Opt for a weather-sealed camera to withstand the UK’s unpredictable weather. This feature ensures that neither rain nor mist will interrupt your shooting session. 2. Lenses: A wide array of lenses is beneficial. Start with a wide-angle lens for expansive landscapes, add a standard lens for those natural perspective shots, and consider a telephoto lens for capturing distant details or compressing landscape layers. 3. Tripod Choices: A sturdy, carbon-fibre tripod with a ball head or geared head provides the stability ns for those natural perspective shots, and consider a telephoto lens for capturing distant details or compressing landscape layers. 3. Tripod Choices: A sturdy, carbon-fibre tripod with a ball head or geared head provides the stability needed for long exposures and helps fine-tune compositions. Ensure it’s lightweight enough for long treks across the countryside.FILTERS AND ACCESSORIES * Filters: Kase's range of filters , including polarisers, neutral-density, and graduated ND filters, are crucial for managing light and enhancing colours.

MASTER COMPOSITION RULES THAT MAKE IMAGES READ FAST AND FEEL BALANCED.This guide turns the classic rules—rule of thirds, symmetry, balance, leading lines, negative space and more—into quick, practical steps. You’ll learn when to use each rule, when to break it, and how to clean your frame so the subject stands out.3 key takeaways * Subject first: pick a clear focal point, simplify distractions, and use negative space, contrast or depth to isolate it. * Structure the frame: apply the rule of thirds (or purposeful symmetry), place horizons with intent, and balance visual weight; watch edges to avoid mergers. * Guide the eye: use leading lines, curves and framing to create flow; direct attention with light/colour; break rules deliberately when it strengthens the story.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------In the art and science of photography, understanding and applying the right photography composition rules can transform a simple photograph into a captivating work of art. The essence of creating an impactful image lies not just in what is captured but also in how it is presented through the lens. Photography composition rules, including the elements of composition in photography and various types of composition in photography, serve as the foundation for visual storytelling . They guide photographers on how to effectively draw the viewer's eye into the scene. Whether one is an aspiring photographer or a seasoned professional, mastering these principles, from basic photo composition to advanced photography composition techniques, is crucial for enhancing the aesthetic appeal and emotional depth of their work.This article delves into the basics of photography composition rules, starting with the fundamentals before exploring essential techniques and advanced tips. It highlights the significance of composition in a photo, from employing the rule of thirds to understanding the importance of breathing space and the role it plays in framing a subject . Readers will gain insights into how these photography composition techniques can be leveraged for more persuasive visual storytelling and explore how continuous practice can lead to a marked improvement in their photographic endeavours. In essence, this guide aims to equip photographers with the knowledge to elevate the composition of their photos, turning ordinary shots into extraordinary stories.UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF PHOTOGRAPHY COMPOSITIONDEFINITION OF COMPOSITIONComposition in photography, fundamentally about the arrangement of visual elements within the frame, can make an image more or less interesting and successful by guiding the viewer's eye through the image. This arrangement, a core aspect of what is composition in photography, involves not just the subject but also the thoughtful application of photo composition principles.IMPORTANCE OF COMPOSITIONEffective composition is crucial as it not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of a photo but also directs the viewer's attention to the intended subjects and narratives. A well-composed image can communicate emotions and stories more powerfully, making it memorable and impactful. This underscores the importance of mastering photo composition and composition meaning in photography.COMMON MISCONCEPTIONSThere are misconceptions that composition must adhere strictly to established rules like the Rule of Thirds or the Golden Ratio. However, these rules of photography and composition are guidelines that can be adapted or even broken to achieve a desired effect or convey a unique perspective in photography.ESSENTIAL COMPOSITION TECHNIQUESQUICK TIPS — ESSENTIAL COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES * Rule of Thirds: Place the subject on power points; keep horizons on a third. * Leading Lines: Use roads, fences, or light to guide the eye toward the subject. * Framing: Doorways, branches, arches—create a frame within the frame for depth. * Balance: Counter-weight a dominant subject with a secondary element or space. * Symmetry & Patterns: Centre when symmetry is strong; break patterns to add focus. * Negative Space: Leave clean space around the subject to simplify and emphasise. * Layering: Include foreground–mid–background to add depth and scale. * Perspective: Change height/angle; get low, high, or closer to simplify mergers. * Figure–Ground: Ensure tonal/colour contrast so the subject separates clearly. * Fill the Frame: Remove distractions; crop lify and emphasise. * Layering: Include foreground–mid–background to add depth and scale. * Perspective: Change height/angle; get low, high, or closer to simplify mergers. * Figure–Ground: Ensure tonal/colour contrast so the subject separates clearly. * Fill the Frame: Remove distractions; crop tight to strengthen impact. * Edges & Mergers: Check frame edges for cut limbs, tangents, or awkward overlaps. * Triangles / Odds: Arrange key points as triangles; odd numbers read more naturally.RULE OF THIRDSThe rule of thirds, a fundamental composition technique in photography, involves a grid of nine equal parts created by two horizontal and two vertical lines. Placing the main subject or focal points along these lines or at their intersections can lead to more balanced and visually appealing photos. This technique beautifully demonstrates how triangles can be used to enhance composition. This technique is versatile and applicable in various photography forms, from landscapes where horizons are aligned with horizontal lines to portraits where subjects are placed at power points for emphasis. Using triangles adds an extra layer of interest and balance to the composition.LEADING LINES (VISUAL PATHWAYS)Leading lines are powerful compositional tools that guide the viewer's eye through the photograph, often leading to the main subject. These can be anything from paths and walls to patterns and natural formations. By strategically positioning these lines, photographers create a sense of depth and dynamism, making the composition more engaging and directing the viewer's attention to areas of interest. The use of diagonals in this context adds to the dynamic quality of the composition.SYMMETRY AND PATTERNSSymmetry in photography provides a visual balance, creating images that are pleasing to the eye. This can be achieved through horizontal, vertical, or radial arrangements where elements mirror each other across an axis. Patterns, whether man-made or natural, add interest and harmony to compositions, often leading to aesthetically pleasing and structured photographs. The repetition of these patterns or elements plays a crucial role in achieving symmetry.FRAMINGFraming involves using elements within the scene to create a 'frame' around the subject , which can enhance the focus and depth of the composition. This technique can utilise various elements such as architectural features, natural frames like trees or rocks, and even light and shadows to draw attention to the main subject and add a narrative layer to the image. It's a strategic way to highlight the subject and add depth to the visual story being told.GRAB THE 1-PAGE COMPOSITION RULES CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 guide — rule of thirds, balance, leading lines, framing & more.Download Composition Rules Checklist (PDF) Book 1-to-1 Help (Zoom) Book the Composition Clinic (£29) Prefer a text link?

Download the Composition Rules Checklist (PDF) ADVANCED COMPOSITION TIPSUSING NEGATIVE SPACENegative space, often seen as the background, defines the mood and enhances the subject by providing a sense of place, which is crucial in nature photography compositions. Effective use of negative space, such as smooth textures or empty areas, draws attention to the subject, creating emotional and balanced images.LAYERING ELEMENTS FOR DEPTHLayering adds a three-dimensional illusion to photographs, which is crucial for visual storytelling. It involves foreground, middle ground, and background layers, each contributing to the image's depth and narrative. Mastering this technique requires practice and awareness of the scene's elements.Rule of Thirds: placing key elements on the thirds lines/intersections guides the eye and balances the frame.BALANCING VISUAL ELEMENTSBalance in composition involves arranging visual elements, sometimes forming triangles, to create stability. Techniques include using symmetry for formal balance and asymmetry for a dynamic feel. Colours, sizes, and textures all contribute to visual weight, affecting the balance and overall impact of the photograph.PLAYING WITH PERSPECTIVES AND VIEWPOINTSExploring different perspectives and viewpoints adds depth and interest to compositions. Techniques include altering the camera angle, using physical or conceptual perspectives, and considering the spatial relationship within the frame. This approach, enriched by context, helps achieve more realistic and engaging photos.EDITING TIPS (5 MINUTES) * Crop & straighten: Enforce your chosen rule (thirds, symmetry); level horizons and verticals. * Aspect ratio: Test 4:5, 1:1, 16:9 to simplify edges and strengthen balance. * Lens & transform: Apply profile corrections; use Upright/Transform to fix keystone lines. * Clean the frame: Heal/clone dust, bright specks and edge clutter that pull the eye. * Figure–ground pop: Subtle local contrast/clarity on the subject; reduce texture in background. * Light direction: Dodge leading lines/subject faces; burn edges/tangents to guide attention. * Colour separation: HSL/Selective Color to nudge hues apart; tame dominant colours by –saturation. * Vignette (feathered): Very soft, centred on point of interest—keep it invisible. * B&W geometry: If colour distracts, convert; adjust channel mix for clean tonal separation. * Extend canvas: Content-aware extend or “Boundary Warp” to add breathing/negative space if tight. * Selective sharpen: Mask sharpening to subject edges; avoid noise in flat areas/sky. * Export check: Re-view at output size; fix haloing, colour banding and over-crisp edges.IMPROVING COMPOSITION THROUGH PRACTICEEXPERIMENTATION AND CREATIVITYPhotographers enhance their skills by embracing experimentation, often breaking from conventional rules like the Rule of Thirds to discover unique perspectives and form compelling triangles in their compositions. Experimenting with different compositions allows photographers to develop a distinctive style that resonates more profoundly with their creati entation, often breaking from conventional rules like the Rule of Thirds to discover unique perspectives and form compelling triangles in their compositions. Experimenting with different compositions allows photographers to develop a distinctive style that resonates more profoundly with their creative vision. It encourages them to think outside the traditional frameworks and adapt to what best suits the scene or their artistic intent, always keeping context in mind.LEARNING FROM CRITIQUEEngaging in the critique process , both giving and receiving feedback, is crucial for growth in photography. This interaction highlights areas for improvement and reinforces successful techniques in one's work. Critiques can provide new insights and perspectives, helping photographers understand how their work is perceived by others and encouraging a deeper analysis of their techniques.CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND ADAPTATIONContinuous learning through the study of photography and other visual arts enriches a photographer’s understanding of composition and visual storytelling. This ongoing process involves adapting to new techniques and perspectives, keeping a photographer’s work dynamic and evolving. Regular practice and revisiting past works to see them with fresh eyes, a practice akin to repetition, contribute significantly to mastering composition.CONCLUSIONThroughout this exploration of photography composition, we've journeyed from the foundational principles to intricate techniques and beyond, ultimately unveiling the vast potential inherent in thoughtful compositional strategies for creating compelling images. The discussion has underscored the pivotal role of composition—not just as a set of rules to follow but as a dynamic canvas for creative expression. By weaving together essential techniques like the rule of thirds, leading lines, and the effective use of negative space with advanced strategies such as layering elements and experimenting with perspectives, photographers are equipped to elevate their visual storytelling to new heights, transforming the ordinary into extraordinary, with the use of triangles and diagonals against a thoughtfully considered background.As we conclude, it's clear that the path to mastering composition is one of continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation. The insights shared here serve as a brief guide and an inspiration for photographers at all levels to refine their craft and discover their unique voice through the lens. Embracing critique and practice with an open heart will lead to unabated growth and innovation in photography. Thus, the journey of improving one's composition is endless, promising ever-evolving landscapes of visual expression and storytelling prowess that await those willing to explore, learn, and persist.----------------------------------------FAQS - PHOTOGRAPHY STYLESWHAT MAKES AN IMAGE TRULY CAPTIVATING?The allure of an image often comes down to its composition, which encompasses various artistic rules and principles.

This post explains how WB interprets the colour of light (temperature in Kelvin + tint), and gives you a simple workflow to get neutrals neutral—or bias colour on purpose. * What WB is: the camera’s colour interpretation of the light source (e.g., tungsten ≈ 3000 K, daylight ≈ 5500–6500 K, shade ≈ 7000–8000 K) plus a green–magenta tint correction. * How to set it: Auto WB, presets (Daylight/Shade/Tungsten/Fluoro), Kelvin for precise control, or Custom WB using a grey card/ExpoDisc—especially for consistent skin tones. * When to fix it: Shoot RAW for full latitude and correct in post with the WB eyedropper; for JPEG or fast delivery, set WB accurately in-camera under consistent light.3 key takeaways 1. Neutral first, creative second: establish a clean reference (grey card or reliable preset), then bias warmer/cooler to taste. 2. Match the key light: in mixed lighting, balance for the light that matters to your subject; control the rest (gels, turn off, or correct locally in post). 3. RAW = freedom: WB isn’t baked in for RAW—fix quickly with the eyedropper and tint slider; for JPEG, get it right in-camera.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------WHAT IS WHITE BALANCE IN PHOTOGR bject; control the rest (gels, turn off, or correct locally in post). 3.

Understanding what is white balance in photography is the key to achieving vibrant and realistic results. In this article, we will explore the concept of white balance and its importance in photography.White balance refers to the colour temperature of light, which affects the overall colour cast in an image. It helps ensure that whites appear white, regardless of the lighting conditions. By adjusting the white balance, photographers can capture accurate and pleasing colours.Different lighting conditions have different colour temperatures. Daylight white balance tends to be cool and bluish, while indoor lighting like tungsten white balance can be warm and yellowish. Understanding the white balance allows photographers to compensate for these colour balance shifts and achieve accurate colour reproduction.Whether you're a professional photographer or a hobbyist, mastering white balance examples will significantly improve the quality of your images. Join us as we dive deep into the world of white balance and unlock the secrets to achieving stunning and lifelike photographs.So, grab your camera, check your camera settings, and get ready to enhance your skills with the power of white balance!UNDERSTANDING WHITE BALANCEWhite balance (WB) is a critical component in photography that adjusts colours to match the true white under different natural lighting conditions. When the white balance is correctly set using the white balance chart or Kelvin scale photography, it ensures colours are natural and accurate to what the human eye perceives in real life.In the heart of every photograph, the light plays a leading role. The colour temperature kelvin of light sources can vary significantly, from the warm glow of a setting sun to the cool shade under an overcast sky. White balance helps in neutralising these colour casts, ensuring that objects which appear white in person are rendered white in your images.Mastering white balance kelvin also means understanding the impact of light's correlated colour temperature, measured in Kelvin (K). Lower Kelvin values like colour temperature 2700k represent warmer, yellowish colours, while higher Kelvin values indicate cooler, bluish tones. By adjusting the white balance, photographers can either correct or creatively alter the mood of their images.DIFFERENT TYPES OF WHITE BALANCE SETTINGSMost digital cameras offer a variety of preset white balances to accommodate different lighting scenarios. These include Auto White Balance (AWB), Daylight, Cloudy, Shade, Tungsten, Fluorescent, and Flash, among custom settings where photographers can manually set the colour temperature chart.Auto White Balance is often reliable in general conditions, adjusting the white balance automatically based on the incident light conditions. However, for more control or in challenging lighting, selecting a preset or custom setting can yield better results.Custom White Balance (CWB) is the pinnacle of control, allowing photographers to calibrate their camera settings to the specific lighting conditions of a scene. This is done by taking a photo of a white or gra r in challenging lighting, selecting a preset or custom setting can yield better results.Custom White Balance (CWB) is the pinnacle of control, allowing photographers to calibrate their camera settings to the specific lighting conditions of a scene. This is done by taking a photo of a white or gray reference card and setting that as the benchmark for true white. CWB can significantly enhance colour accuracy in your images, especially in scenes with multiple illuminants.THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRECT WHITE BALANCE✓ DO * Match the key light: choose a preset/Kelvin for the light illuminating your subject. * Use a neutral reference (grey card/ExpoDisc) for Custom WB when colour accuracy matters. * Shoot RAW to adjust temperature and tint later without quality loss. * Check skin tones and neutrals; fine-tune Tint (G↔M) as well as Temperature (K). * Control mixed light: switch off, gel, or local-correct with masks in post.✗ DON’T * Don’t leave AWB on for everything—it can drift or fail in mixed/coloured lighting. * Don’t rely on Temperature only; ignoring Tint often leaves green/magenta casts. * Don’t move from daylight to tungsten (or shade to sun) without updating WB. * Don’t try to globally fix mixed light with one slider—use local tools or gels. * Don’t bake critical colour as JPEG if unsure—prefer RAW or set a custom WB in-camera.Tip: establish a neutral baseline first, then warm/cool creatively for mood.Correct white balance is vital for achieving photographs that accurately reflect the scene you're capturing. Incorrect white balance can lead to images with an unnatural colour cast, making them appear too warm light source (orange or yellow) or too cool light source (blue), detracting from the visual appeal and realism.Moreover, white balance affects the colour harmony in your images. True-to-life colours contribute to a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing photograph. Especially in genres like portraiture, product photography, or fine art, where colour accuracy is paramount, mastering white balance is essential.Understanding and utilising white balance not only improves image quality but also reduces post-processing work. Achieving the right white balance in-camera means less time correcting colours in editing software, allowing more time for creative enhancements rather than basic corrections. This is especially important when shooting in JPEG format, as JPEG files have less flexibility for colour balance adjustment compared to RAW files.COMMON WHITE BALANCE MISTAKES TO AVOIDOne of the most common mistakes is overlooking the white balance setting, leaving it on Auto White Balance in every situation. While AWB works well in many conditions, it can struggle in mixed lighting or more complex environments.Another mistake is not adjusting the white balance when moving between different lighting conditions. For example, shooting outdoors in daylight white balance and then moving indoors without changing the white balance can result in inaccurately coloured images.Failing to customise the white balance in particularly tricky lighting conditions, such as scenes dominated by a single colour or under artificial lighting like fluorescent or tungsten white balance, can also lead to poor colour rendition. It's essential to evaluate and adjust the white balance whenever the lighting scenario changes significantly.HOW TO ADJUST WHITE BALANCE IN-CAMERAAdjusting the white balance in-camera involves selecting t ghting like fluorescent or tungsten white balance, can also lead to poor colour rendition. It's essential to evaluate and adjust the white balance whenever the lighting scenario changes significantly.HOW TO ADJUST WHITE BALANCE IN-CAMERAAdjusting the white balance in-camera involves selecting the appropriate preset based on your lighting situation or setting a custom white balance. To select a preset, navigate to your camera settings for white balance and choose the option that matches your environment, such as Daylight, Cloudy, or Tungsten.For custom white balance, you'll need to photograph a neutral reference, like a white balance card, under the same lighting conditions as your subject. Then, follow your camera's instructions to set this image as the reference point for white balance. This method allows for precise colour balance correction tailored to your specific shooting conditions.HOW TO SET WHITE BALANCE (PRESETS, KELVIN & CUSTOM) 1. Prep: shoot RAW (max latitude) and pick a neutral picture profile. If colour-critical, keep a grey card handy. 2. Choose your method (from quick → precise): * Auto WB (AWB): fine for changing daylight; can drift in mixed/coloured light. * Presets: fast and consistent. * Daylight: 5200–5600 K * Cloudy: 6000–6500 K * Shade: 7000–8000 K * Tungsten/Incandescent: 2800–3200 K * Fluorescent: 3800–4500 K (often needs +magenta tint) * Flash: 5500–6000 K * Kelvin (K): enable Temp/K on the camera, dial until neutrals look neutral in live view; then nudge Tint (G↔M) if needed. Good starting points are above. * Custom WB (grey card / ExpoDisc): 1. Place the card in your key light (same light as your subject). 2. Fill the frame with the card and capture a reference. 3. Run Custom WB in the menu and assign it to a slot. 4. Use that WB for all shots under the same lighting. 3. Handle mixed light: balance for the key light, then tame the rest (turn off, gel flash to match ambient, or correct locally in post with masks). 4. Verify quickly: check skin tones and a known neutral (shirt, card, wall). If it looks green/magenta, adjust Tint, not just Temperature. 5. In post (RAW): use the WB eyedropper on a neutral, fine-tune Temp/Tint; for scenes lit by different sources, apply local WB per area.Tip: shoot a quick grey-card frame whenever the light changes. It’s a perfect anchor for consistent white balance across a set.WHITE BALANCE IN POST-PROCESSINGPost-processing software like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop offers powerful tools for adjusting white balance after the fact. These tools can be invaluable, especially if the white balance wasn't correctly set in-camera or if you're working with RAW files, which retain much more information for adjustment compared to JPE files.The white balance selector tool, often represented by an eyedropper, allows you to click on a neutral reference grey or white area in your image to automatically adjust the white balance. For more fine-tuned adjustments, colour temperature kelvin and tint sliders enable you to manually correct or creatively alter the white balance.Post-processing is also an opportunity to explore creative white balance adjustments. While it's important to achieve natural-looking colours, altering the white balance can help convey a specific mood or atmosphere, enhancing the storytelling aspect of your photography. However, be cautious not to overdo the adjustments, an opportunity to explore creative white balance adjustments. While it's important to achieve natural-looking colours, altering the white balance can help convey a specific mood or atmosphere, enhancing the storytelling aspect of your photography. However, be cautious not to overdo the adjustments, as extreme changes can result in an unnatural or unappealing colour spectrum.CONCLUSION: WHAT IS WHITE BALANCEMastering camera white balance is a fundamental aspect of photography that can dramatically improve the quality of your images. Whether you're adjusting settings in-camera or fine-tuning colours in post-processing, understanding what colour temperature is and how it relates to white balance is crucial for achieving realistic and visually appealing photographs.By familiarising yourself with different white balance settings, recognising common mistakes, and utilising the right tools and techniques, you'll be well on your way to capturing stunning images that accurately reflect the beauty of the world around you.So, embrace the power of white balance and let it transform your photography into a true reflection of reality infused with your artistic vision.

By stripping away colour, black and white images highlight the essence of a scene, drawing attention to texture, form, and composition in ways that colour photography often cannot match.For beginners eager to explore this captivating medium and ges through its use of shadows, contrast, and tones. By stripping away colour, black and white images highlight the essence of a scene, drawing attention to texture, form, and composition in ways that colour photography often cannot match.For beginners eager to explore this captivating medium and learn how to take black and white photos, mastering black and white photography involves understanding its fundamental principles and techniques. This black and white photography for beginners article will guide novice photographers through the basics of camera settings, composition strategies, and post-processing methods specific to black and white imagery. By learning to see the world in monochrome and harnessing the dramatic potential of light and shadow, beginners can create striking photographs that resonate with viewers and stand the test of time.BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY — ROADMAP * Why B&W: Remove colour to emphasise light, shape, texture and emotion. Use B&W by choice, not as a rescue. * See in Tones: Pre-visualise contrast and shadow. Look for strong edges, patterns, and graphic forms. * Camera Setup: Shoot RAW; enable mono preview to compose in tones. Protect highlights; expose with intent. * Light: Directional/hard light boosts contrast; soft light suits subtle gradations. Use backlight for silhouettes. * Compose for Impact: Lead with lines and shapes; simplify backgrounds; use negative space; mind your edges. * Process with Purpose: Convert with B&W mix, shape with curves and dodge/burn; aim for full tonal range. * Texture & Detail: Sharpen selectively; enhance texture where it matters; avoid crunchy halos. * Consistency: Develop a repeatable toning/contrast style so sets feel cohesive and intentional.Strip scenes to essentials: light, form, texture, and mood. Plan exposure, compose graphically, and finish with restrained, tonal edits.UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHYQUICK TIPS — THE BASICS OF B&W * B&W strips away colour so you must rely on contrast, shape, and texture to tell the story. * Key elements: tonal contrast, strong composition, tactile texture, mood-setting lighting, full tonal range. * Shoot in RAW and convert later for maximum control over tone mapping and creative direction.WHAT IS BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY?Black and white photography, also known as monochromatic photography, is the oldest form of capturing images. It strips away colour, focusing on light intensity and tonal variations. This timeless medium has the power to create stark, dramatic images that stand the test of time, as demonstrated by famous black and white photography from artists like Ansel Adams and Henri Cartier-Bresson. In the digital age, photographers can shoot in colour and convert to black and white during post-processing, allowing for greater control over the final black and white photo.BENEFITS OF SHOOTING IN BLACK AND WHITEBlack and white photography has a unique ability to distance content from reality, instantly capturing viewers' attention. By removing the distraction of colour, it emphasises shape, form, and pattern in the image. This technique is particularly effective for highlighting textures and creating a sense of timelessness, making it ideal for genres like portrait black and white photography and black and white fine art photography. It's also an excellent tool for beginners to learn the fundamentals of photography, as it simplifies the process by eliminating the comp hting textures and creating a sense of timelessness, making it ideal for genres like portrait black and white photography and black and white fine art photography. It's also an excellent tool for beginners to learn the fundamentals of photography, as it simplifies the process by eliminating the complexity of colour.KEY ELEMENTS OF A STRONG B&W IMAGETo create compelling black and white photographs, photographers should focus on several key elements: 1. Contrast: The interplay between light and shadow is crucial in black and white photography. High contrast black and white photography can convey movement and energy, while low contrast creates a softer, more muted effect. 2. Composition: Without colour to guide the eye, composition becomes even more critical. Strong graphic elements and careful framing are essential to create visually engaging black and white images. 3. Texture: Emphasising texture adds depth and personality to black and white photographs, bringing the image to life. 4. Lighting: All types of light can work in black and white photography, from harsh midday sun to moody, overcast conditions. The key is to use lighting to enhance contrast and create atmosphere, whether it's high key or low key lighting. 5. Tonal range : A well-executed black and white image should have a full range of tones, from pure black to pure white, with various shades of grey in between. Remember to read my post on what do camera filters do View fullsizeESSENTIAL CAMERA SETTINGS AND TECHNIQUESQUICK TIPS — CAMERA SETTINGS & TECHNIQUES * Shoot RAW for full tonal control during conversion; mono-mode helps you visualise B&W in-camera. * Use directional or hard light to enhance tonal contrast. Slight overexposure helps retain shadow detail. * Meter exposure carefully—highlights are harder to fix than shadows in B&W.To create compelling black and white photographs, photographers should focus on specific camera settings and techniques. These approaches help to capture images with the necessary contrast, tonal range, and detail for impactful monochrome conversions.SHOOTING IN RAWCapturing images in RAW format provides the greatest flexibility for post-processing. RAW files preserve all the colour information from the camera's sensor, allowing photographers to make precise adjustments during the black and white conversion process. This format gives greater control over tonal mapping, contrast, and the application of digital color filters, similar to using physical filters with black and white film.USING YOUR CAMERA'S MONOCHROME MODEMany digital cameras offer a black and white mode, which can be a valuable tool for visualising black and white compositions. When enabled, this setting displays images in black and white on the camera's LCD screen or electronic viewfinder. This preview helps photographers see how the scene translates to monochrome, making it easier to assess contrast, tonal relationships, and the overall impact of the composition without the distraction of colour.ADJUSTING CONTRAST AND EXPOSUREContrast plays a crucial role in black and white photography. Photographers should pay attention to lighting conditions that create strong tonal differences. Directional light, hard light, and backlighti impact of the composition without the distraction of colour.ADJUSTING CONTRAST AND EXPOSUREContrast plays a crucial role in black and white photography. Photographers should pay attention to lighting conditions that create strong tonal differences. Directional light, hard light, and backlighting can produce striking contrasts between bright and dark areas. When shooting, it's often beneficial to slightly overexpose the image to retain detail in the shadows , as it's easier to recover highlight detail in post-processing than to bring out information from underexposed shadows. Adjusting ISO, aperture, and shutter speed can help achieve the desired exposure and contrast.View fullsizeCOMPOSITION TIPS FOR IMPACTFUL B&W IMAGESQUICK TIPS — COMPOSITION IN B&W * Emphasise shapes, textures, and lines—without colour, they carry your message. * Use leading lines—horizontal for stability, vertical for strength, diagonals for movement. * High contrast and silhouettes dramatise forms—use light and shadow to guide mood.EMPHASISING SHAPES AND TEXTURESIn black and white photography, shapes and textures play a crucial role in creating visually striking images. Without colour, photographers must rely on these elements to add depth and interest to their compositions. To achieve this, one should look for subjects with interesting textures, such as weathered wood, rough stone, or intricate patterns. These textures can be enhanced in post-processing using tools like Clarity and Texture sliders, but it's essential to use them judiciously. The key is to find a balance that brings out the details without overdoing the effect.USING LEADING LINESLeading lines serve as powerful compositional tools in black and white photography. They guide the viewer's eye through the image, creating a sense of depth and movement. Photographers can utilise various types of leading lines , including horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and curved. Each type conveys a different feeling: horizontal lines suggest stability, vertical lines imply power and confidence, diagonal lines create a sense of movement, and curved lines add a dynamic flow to the image. When composing a shot, one should look for natural or man-made lines that direct attention towards the main subject or focal point of the photograph.CREATING CONTRAST THROUGH LIGHT AND SHADOWContrast is a fundamental element in black and white photography, and it can be effectively achieved through the interplay of light and shadow. High-contrast scenes, where bright highlights meet deep shadows, often translate well to monochrome images. To create dramatic black-and-white photographs, one should expose the highlights and allow the shadows to fall where they may. This approach can result in mysterious, dark areas that add depth and intrigue to the image. Silhouettes are another powerful technique for utilising contrast, especially when the subject has an interesting shape against a bright background.View fullsizePOST-PROCESSING YOUR BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOSQUICK TIPS — POST-PROCESSING B&W * Convert properly—use B&W mix panels, curves, and dodge/burn to sculpt light and tone. * Sharpen carefully; add subtle texture; apply toning for mood, but don’t overdo it. * Use the full tonal range—true black, whites, and rich grays—for depth and impact.CONVERTING COLOUR IMAGES TO B&WMost photographers create black and x panels, curves, and dodge/burn to sculpt light and tone. * Sharpen carefully; add subtle texture; apply toning for mood, but don’t overdo it. * Use the full tonal range—true black, whites, and rich grays—for depth and impact.CONVERTING COLOUR IMAGES TO B&WMost photographers create black and white photographs using colour, digital raw files. This process involves more than simply desaturating a photo or converting it to Grayscale in Photoshop. Converting colour to black and white has its own workflow and creative considerations. When removing colour, it's crucial to consider whether it enhances or detracts from the image. Colours that don't tell a story or add visual interest are often better removed, allowing textures, shapes, and contours to become more noticeable.ADJUSTING TONES AND CONTRASTAfter conversion, photographers can adjust tones and contrast to create dramatic effects. This can be done by applying heavier dodging and burning than one would normally do with colour images. Adjusting exposure can create low-key or high-key images, while increasing contrast can emphasise shapes and lines. The Black & White Mix panel in Adobe Lightroom allows for fine-tuning of individual colour sensitivities, raising or lowering their luminosity in the black and white image.ADDING FINISHING TOUCHESTo complete the post-processing, photographers often apply additional adjustments. These may include sharpening the image, refining masks to target specific areas, and adjusting black and white points for richer shadows and highlights. Texture can be enhanced to bring out details in elements like stone or foliage. Toning can also be used to add a subtle colour tint to the monochrome image. It's important to use a light touch when making these adjustments to avoid introducing noise, artefacts, or banding. The goal is to produce smooth black and white tones while maintaining a balance between true black, true white, and the range of greys in between.View fullsizeCONCLUSIONBlack and white photography has a unique ability to capture the essence of a scene, drawing attention to form, texture, and composition in ways that colour images often can't match. By focusing on the interplay of light and shadow, photographers can create striking images that have a timeless quality. Mastering this art form involves understanding camera settings, composition techniques, and post-processing methods specific to monochrome imagery.For beginners, diving into black and white photography opens up a world of creative possibilities. It challenges photographers to see beyond colour and focus on the fundamental elements of visual storytelling. With practise and patience, newcomers can develop their skills to create powerful black and white images that resonate with viewers and stand the test of time. This journey of exploration and learning can lead to a deeper appreciation of photography as an art form, whether you're capturing landscapes, portraits, street photography, or any other genre that lends itself to beautiful black and white photos.MASTER BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPHYDownload the 1-page field checklist or book live support.Download B&W Checklist (PDF) Image Reviews Clinic (Zoom, £29) [https://schedule-me-alan-ranger.as.me/imagereviewsclinic?ut",

This protection is enforced under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and non-compliance can lead to substantial fines. These measures are crucial for preserving the beauty of these the UK, English bluebells are protected by law, meaning they cannot be picked or stood on during family portraits. This protection is enforced under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and non-compliance can lead to substantial fines. These measures are crucial for preserving the beauty of these flowers and supporting the balance and health of the ecosystems they grace.The protection of bluebells extends beyond aesthetics; these flowers are integral to the bluebell habitat they thrive in. They offer an early source of nectar for bees, butterflies, and other insects. Moreover, their dense carpets inhibit the growth of other plants, thus maintaining the unique character of the bluebell woods.As photographers, we bear the responsibility to respect the protections in place for bluebells, ensuring our bluebell photo sessions do not harm these fragile blooms or their environment. This includes careful movement to avoid crushing the flowers, resisting the temptation to pick them, and educating others about the significance of preserving these exquisite flowers. By being mindful of where we step and sticking to established paths, we can minimise our impact and still capture the beauty of the bluebells.So, as you immerse yourself in the enchanting bluebell forest to capture its magical beauty, remember that these flowers are a treasured part of our natural heritage that deserve our utmost care and respect.Photographers have a wide range of techniques to capture bluebells without causing any harm to them during a bluebell photoshoot. Shooting low and close to the flowers, using overcast and dull conditions for even lighting, and trying different angles can avoid stepping on them or disrupting their natural setting.> According to research carried out by Moulton College in the Midlands, once damaged, bluebells need approximately five years, without any additional disturbance, to recover fully. Not only does trampling cause a loss of up to 96% of the bluebells’ flowers, but the species also cannot produce seeds as efficiently, consequently affecting many generations to come.https://heartwoodforest.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/save-our-bluebells-2017/ If you see others trampling on them explain why that’s causing damage and how it can take up to five years for them to recover, if undisturbed again. Most woodlands have paths so stick to those and be mindful of your impact on the ecology of the woodlands.BLUEBELL WOODLAND PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOPS: ADVANTAGES OF AN ORGANISED PHOTOSHOOTDelving into a Bluebell Photography Workshop offers you: * Exclusive access to a private bluebell woodland in Warwickshire * An enriching experience * Hands-on practical experience * Professional techniques for photographing bluebells * Topics taught and discussed such as choosing the best lens and engaging with post-processing techniques * Ample opportunities to practice in a real-life settingThe workshops offer a wide range of techniques for photographing bluebells, such as: * capturing dappled light through the trees * managing contrast by paying attention to the histogram * avoiding excessive sky in compositions * maximizing colour saturation in different lighting * utilising strong light at the beginning or end of the day * adopting a low viewpoint for a soft foreground look with neutral tonesParticipants will learn these techniques to enhance their ogram * avoiding excessive sky in compositions * maximizing colour saturation in different lighting * utilising strong light at the beginning or end of the day * adopting a low viewpoint for a soft foreground look with neutral tonesParticipants will learn these techniques to enhance their bluebell photography skills.Warwickshire, with its stunning bluebell woodlands, is an amazing location for these workshops.

That’s usually the wrong drive mode for the job.How this article helps: Clear, quick guidance on when to use Single, Continuous (CL/CH), Self-timer/Remote, Bracketing, Quiet/Silent, and Interval—plus simple defaults to reduce blur and boost hit rate.3 key takeaways 1. Match motion to mode: Single for static; Continuous for movement (use CL to pace bursts, CH for split-second peaks). 2. Kill shutter-press shake: Self-timer or Remote on tripod (add EFCS/Mirror-up if available) for tack-sharp long exposures. 3. Bracket smart: Use AEB in the drive menu for high-contrast scenes; shoot short, controlled bursts to avoid buffer clogs.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTIONIn photography, capturing moments and using creative techniques is important. Modern DSLR cameras have specialised camera drive modes that allow photographers to go beyond a single exposure. These drive modes help include the photographer in group portraits, reduce camera shake in long exposures, and create artistic composites. Understanding drive modes unlocks a world of possibilities and allows photographers to adapt to different scenarios like sports photography, wildlife photography, and wedding photography. Mastering these camera settings will help you use amera shake in long exposures, and create artistic composites. Understanding drive modes unlocks a world of possibilities and allows photographers to adapt to different scenarios like sports photography, wildlife photography, and wedding photography. Mastering these camera settings will help you use your camera to your full potential to maximise image quality when capturing motion.PAIN POINTS: * Missing peak moments due to the camera's single-shot limitation * Inability to capture fast-paced action or motion blur creatively * Lack of control over the camera's image capture sequence * Difficulty incorporating oneself into group portraits or long exposures * Inadequate knowledge of specialised drive modes and their applicationsBy exploring the nuances of camera drive modes, this article addresses these pain points, equipping readers with the insights to: * Seamlessly capture rapid sequences and decisive moments * Freeze fast action or intentionally blur motion for creative effects * Remotely trigger the shutter for sharper images and self-portraits * Leverage advanced modes for minimising camera shake and vibrations * Unlock artistic potential through techniques like multiple exposures * If you want hands-on guidance and support using these modes - Join one of our outdoor workshops to turn theory into practice.----------------------------------------CAMERA DRIVE MODES — QUICK REFERENCEMode (aliases) What it fires Best for Tips / gotchas Single (S) One frame per press Posed portraits, product, landscapes Most precise timing; pair with AF-S and a safe shutter to avoid micro-blur. Continuous Low (CL) Controlled burst while held Candid people, street, casual action Easier culling than CH; maintains AF tracking more reliably on some bodies. Continuous High (CH / H+) Maximum fps burst while held Peak action: sports, wildlife, BIF Watch buffer; pre-focus and use fast cards. AF-C + appropriate area/subject detect. Self-timer (2s / 10s) Delayed single (or bracket) sequence Tripod work, long exposure, group shots Removes press-shake; combine with EFCS/Mirror-up for maximum sharpness. Remote (cable/app) Fire without touching camera Astro, macro, any vibration-sensitive work Use exposure delay if available; keep phone screen dim at night. Quiet / Silent (electronic) Very quiet or fully silent shutter Ceremonies, wildlife, theatres May cause banding under LED/flicker; rolling-shutter distortion; flash often disabled. Bracketing drive (AEB) Auto 3–9 frames at set EV steps HDR, high-contrast scenes, exposure insurance Often requires Continuous/Timer to complete in one press; keep the camera steady. Interval / Time-lapse Frames at set intervals (start→end) Clouds, city flow, astro, flowers Lock exposure WB/focus for consistency; mind battery and card space; enable flicker reduction if offered. Mirror-Up / EFCS Reduces mirror/shutter shock Telephoto on tripod, macro, long exposures Use with timer/remote; EFCS helps avoid “shutter shock” at mid speeds. Pre-capture / Pre-shoot (brand feature) Buffers frames before full press Unpredictable peaks (bird take-off, strikes) Heavy buffer/battery use; practice half-press timing and card management.Tip: tie drive mode to a custom button or shooting mode, and pair it with the right AF mode/area and minimum shutter settings to keep your hit rate high.UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTALS: SINGLE SHOT MODEArguably, the most commonly used mode is the single-s half-press timing and card management.Tip: tie drive mode to a custom button or shooting mode, and pair it with the right AF mode/area and minimum shutter settings to keep your hit rate high.UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTALS: SINGLE SHOT MODEArguably, the most commonly used mode is the single-shot drive, which is the default setting for most cameras. It captures a single image with each press of the shutter button and is ideal for static subjects like portraits, still life, or landscape photography.The single-shot mode is straightforward and is a foundation for understanding more advanced camera drive settings. It ensures capturing a single decisive moment without unintentional multiple exposures or rapid-fire bursts.FREEZING ACTION: CONTINUOUS SHOOTING (BURST MODE)Continuous shooting mode is essential for photographers capturing fleeting expressions or fast-moving subjects. It allows for a rapid-fire sequence of images by holding down the shutter button. This mode is particularly useful for wildlife photography with animals in motion or candid moments at weddings or family gatherings.Modern cameras offer different levels of continuous shooting speeds, categorised as \"low\" and \"high\" burst rates. The low burst rate is ideal for subtle movements or expressions, while the high burst mode is perfect for freezing fast action like a sprinter crossing the finish line or a bird taking flight. Use a fast shutter speed as the key for that freeze motion photography.Note that the maximum frames per second (fps) in continuous shooting mode can vary based on factors such as: 1. Autofocus mode: Continuous autofocus, which tracks moving subjects, may slightly reduce the burst rate compared to single autofocus, where focus is locked after the initial frame. 2. Camera hardware: High-end cameras often boast faster processors and larger buffer sizes, enabling higher burst rates and longer sustained sequences. 3. Image file format: Shooting in RAW format typically results in a lower burst rate compared to JPEG, as RAW files are larger and consume more buffer space. 4. Memory card speed: Faster read/write memory cards can transfer data from the camera's buffer more efficiently, sustaining higher burst rates for extended periods.By mastering the continuous shooting mode and camera settings for fast action, you'll gain the ability to capture a series of frames, increasing your chances of capturing that perfect moment and offering a wider selection to choose from during post-processing. These are key action photography techniques and sports photography tips.CAPTURING YOURSELF: SELF-TIMER MODEThe self-timer mode allows you to be part of a group portrait or create a self-portrait without a remote shutter release. Cameras offer preset delay options, typically ranging from 2 to 10 seconds, giving you time to position yourself before the shutter releases. The self-timer mode is also useful for shooting long exposures, such as night landscape photography or light trails, especially in photography in poor light. By triggering the shutter remotely, you eliminate camera shake and capture sharper, blur-free images. Some cameras offer additional features like mirror lockup to minimize vibrations during long exposures, providing a solution for capturing sharp images in low-light conditions.DISCREET OPERATION: QUIET MODEIn certain environments, such as wedding photography ceremonies or theatrical performances, the audible mirror slap o l features like mirror lockup to minimize vibrations during long exposures, providing a solution for capturing sharp images in low-light conditions.DISCREET OPERATION: QUIET MODEIn certain environments, such as wedding photography ceremonies or theatrical performances, the audible mirror slap of a DSLR camera can be disruptive and unwelcome. Fortunately, many cameras offer a quiet mode that slows down the mirror mechanism's operation, significantly reducing the noise generated during image capture.While this mode may slightly decrease the maximum burst rate, it allows you to operate your camera discreetly, capturing candid moments without drawing attention to yourself or disrupting the ambiance of the event.It's important to note that mirrorless cameras, which lack a traditional mirror mechanism, inherently operate silently, negating the need for a dedicated quiet mode.REMOTE TRIGGERING: WIRELESS AND WIRED RELEASESRemote shutter releases, whether wireless or wired, allow you to trigger your camera's shutter without physically touching it. Wireless releases, such as infrared or radio-controlled ones, offer flexibility and freedom from physical constraints. Wired releases provide a more secure and reliable connection, which is useful in environments with potential interference or when working with off-camera lighting setups. Many cameras support remote releases in conjunction with other drive modes, enhancing your ability to capture sharp images in challenging conditions.MINIMISING VIBRATIONS: MIRROR LOCKUP MODEQUICK TIPS — MULTIPLE EXPOSURE MODE * Pick the blend: Average/Auto Gain = camera normalises exposure per frame; Additive = exposures add up (dial ~−1 EV per extra frame); Lighten = keeps brighter areas (great for silhouettes/light trails). * Set frames: choose 2–9 images; enable Save source images so you can edit the parts later. * Stabilise & align: tripod + Live View overlay/“ghost” guide if available; keep backgrounds simple to avoid clutter. * Meter smart: for Additive, underexpose each frame (e.g., 2 frames ≈ −1 EV each, 3 frames ≈ −1.5 EV total split across frames). For Average, expose normally. * Control subject movement: static for clean edges; deliberate movement for dreamy composites. Lock WB/ISO to keep colour/noise consistent. * Silhouette trick (Lighten): first frame = dark subject against bright sky; subsequent frames = textures/shapes that will appear only in bright areas.No in-camera mode? In Photoshop: File → Scripts → Load Files into Stack → set upper layers to Lighten or Screen → refine with masks. Try converting layers to a Smart Object and Layer → Smart Objects → Stack Mode → Mean/Median for different looks.Ideas: subject + texture overlay, time-slice jumps (2–4 frames), reflective symmetry (rotate a second frame 180° and blend).For photographers specialising in long exposures, like astrophotography or architectural photography, camera vibration can cause blur. The mirror up mode solves this by raising and locking the camera's mirror before the shutter opens, eliminating vibrations caused by the mirror slap. This mode is useful when shooting from a tripod or in low-light conditions with extended shutter speeds. However, note that with the mirror locked up, alternative focusing methods like live view or man ng the camera's mirror before the shutter opens, eliminating vibrations caused by the mirror slap. This mode is useful when shooting from a tripod or in low-light conditions with extended shutter speeds. However, note that with the mirror locked up, alternative focusing methods like live view or manual focus are necessary as the viewfinder will be obstructed. Some cameras allow combining mirror lockup with other drive modes, like self-timer or remote release, for vibration-free images in challenging environments.CREATIVE COMPOSITES: MULTIPLE EXPOSURE MODEUnleash your artistic vision with the multiple exposure mode. This mode allows you to combine two or more separate images onto a single frame, opening up creative possibilities such as blending elements, creating surreal composites, or experimenting with abstract compositions.When using multiple exposure mode, consider the background and subject movement between exposures to avoid ghosting or unintended overlaps. For optimal results, use a tripod and shoot static subjects or intentionally incorporate movement for artistic creative blur effects.If your camera doesn't have a dedicated multiple exposure mode, you can achieve similar results by combining individual images during post-processing using software like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.OPTIMISING YOUR WORKFLOW: DRIVE MODE BEST PRACTICESTo fully harness the power of camera drive modes, it's essential to incorporate best practices into your workflow. Here are some valuable tips to consider: 1. Check Your Drive Mode Before Shooting: Develop the habit of double-checking your drive mode settings before capturing critical moments. Accidentally leaving your camera in burst mode during a wedding photography ceremony or switching to self-timer mode during a fast-paced event can lead to missed opportunities. 2. Continuous Autofocus for Moving Subjects: When shooting in continuous burst mode, consider enabling continuous autofocus if your subject is moving towards or away from you. This ensures that your subject remains in sharp focus throughout the sequence, especially when working with shallow depth of field. 3. Leverage Remote, Self-Timer, and Mirror Lockup for Long Exposures: For long exposure photography, such as night landscape photography or light trails, combine the remote release, self-timer, and mirror lockup modes to minimize camera shake and vibrations, resulting in sharper, blur-free images. 4. Experiment with Multiple Exposure Techniques: Embrace the creative potential of multiple exposure mode by experimenting with various subject combinations, movements, and post-processing techniques. This mode can open up a world of artistic expression and unique visual storytelling. 5. Monitor Buffer and Memory Card Performance: When shooting in continuous burst mode, keep an eye on your camera's buffer size and memory card speed. A full buffer or slow memory card can significantly impact the burst rate and duration, potentially causing you to miss critical moments.UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITY: SPECIALISED APPLICATIONSQUICK TIPS — SPECIALISED APPLICATIONSPANNING FOR MOTION BLUR * Drive: CL (continuous–low) for controlled bursts while you pan. * Shutter: start ~1/30–1/60 s (cars); 1/15–1/30 s (cyclists); adjust to taste. * AF: AF-C + Zone/Tracking on the subject; stabilisation in panning mode if available. * Technique: plant your feet, rotate at the hips, press smoothly through the pass; shoot short bursts.LIGHT",

It’s why a 35 mm lens “feels different” on two cameras and why high-ISO results vary. Confusion over crop factor and “equivalence” leads to missed shots and wasted spend.This post solves it: you’ll get a clear, practical guide to crop factor, equivalent focal length and DoF, high-ISO/DR differences, and when a lighter APS-C kit beats a heavier full-frame. Simple rules, sample setups, and buying tips—no myths. * ✔ Field of view & DoF made simple: crop factor affects framing; multiply focal length by 1.5×/1.6× for FOV on APS-C. For DoF equivalence (not exposure), multiply the f-number by the crop factor. * ✔ Noise & dynamic range: larger sensors generally give cleaner high-ISO and more DR at the same output size and exposure—handy for low light and heavy edits. * ✔ Match the tool to the job: APS-C = extra “reach”, smaller/lighter/cheaper kits for wildlife, travel, sports. Full-frame = better low-light/ultra-wide options and shallower DoF for portraits.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTIONUNDERSTANDING CAMERA SENSORS: FULL FRAME VS CROPPED SENSORIn the ever-evolving world of digital photography, the debate between full frame vs crop sensor cameras has been a topic of intense discussion. portraits.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTIONUNDERSTANDING CAMERA SENSORS: FULL FRAME VS CROPPED SENSORIn the ever-evolving world of digital photography, the debate between full frame vs crop sensor cameras has been a topic of intense discussion. As an experienced photographer, I have had the privilege of working with both types of sensors, and it's time to shed light on this captivating crop sensor vs full frame dilemma.SUMMARY OF THE DIFFERENT SENSOR SIZESA full-frame camera has a sensor that is the same size as a 35mm film frame, measuring approximately 36mm x 24mm. On the other hand, a crop sensor camera, also known as an APS-C sensor, is smaller, typically around 22mm x 15mm. This size difference has significant implications for image quality, depth of field, and focal length equivalence, among other factorsSENSOR SIZES, RESOLUTION & QUALITY — QUICK REFERENCEBigger sensors collect more light at the same framing and f-number. That usually means cleaner files at higher ISO, more dynamic range, and the option for shallower depth-of-field. Smaller sensors give you extra “reach”, deeper DoF and lighter kits. * Field of view (FOV): use focal length × crop factor to compare framing (APS-C≈1.5×, MFT≈2×). * DoF equivalence: to match blur for the same framing, use f-number × crop factor (e.g., MFT f/2 ≈ FF f/4). * Noise/DR rule of thumb: larger sensor area ≈ about 1 stop cleaner per 2× area increase (same generation, same output size). * Resolution vs quality: megapixels set potential detail, but lens quality, sensor size (photosite size) and exposure control how clean that detail is.Sensor Crop Typical MP Usable ISO† DoF Control Comfortable Print @300 dpi* Medium Format ≈0.64× 50–100 MP 6400–12800 Shallowest 24×16″ to 40×27″+ Full-Frame (35 mm) 1.0× 24–61 MP 3200–12800 Shallow 20×13″ to 36×24″ APS-C 1.5× / 1.6× 20–40 MP 1600–6400 Moderate 16×10″ to 24×16″ Micro Four Thirds 2.0× 16–25 MP 800–3200 Deeper 13×9″ to 20×13″ 1″ / Phones 2.7× / 5.6× 12–20 MP 400–1600 Deepest 10×7″ to 13×9″Choose by job: * Travel/Wildlife: APS-C or MFT for lighter kits and extra “reach”. * Portraits/Low light: Full-frame for cleaner high-ISO and shallower DoF. * Large prints/Retouch: Full-frame or Medium Format for resolution + DR.† Usable ISO is a conservative RAW guideline (good exposure). *Print sizes assume typical anti-aliasing/sharpness; great lenses can push larger.----------------------------------------ADVANTAGES OF FULL FRAME CAMERAS 1. Superior Image Quality: Full frame sensor cameras have larger individual photosites, which translates to better light-gathering capabilities and lower noise levels, especially in low-light situations. This results in images with greater dynamic range, richer colours, finer details, and higher image resolution. 2. Shallow Depth of Field: Due to the larger sensor size, full frame photography allows you to achieve a shallower depth of field at the same aperture and focal length settings compared to crop sensor cameras. This characteristic is highly desirable for portrait photography, where a beautifully blurred background (bokeh effect) can isolate the subject and create a visually stunning effect. 3. Wide Angle Versatility: Full frame cameras can take full advantage of wide-angle lenses, capturing expansive scenes without the need for specialized ultra-wide lenses. This flexibility is invaluable for landscape photography, architectural, te the subject and create a visually stunning effect. 3. Wide Angle Versatility: Full frame cameras can take full advantage of wide-angle lenses, capturing expansive scenes without the need for specialized ultra-wide lenses. This flexibility is invaluable for landscape photography, architectural, and interior photography.ADVANTAGES OF CROPPED SENSOR CAMERAS 1. Effective Focal Length Magnification: The smaller sensor size of crop sensor cameras results in a crop factor, which effectively multiplies the focal length of a lens. For example, a 50mm lens on an APS-C crop factor camera with a 1.6x crop factor behaves like an 80mm lens on a full frame camera. This characteristic can be advantageous for sports photography, wildlife photography, and action photography, where longer focal lengths are often desired. 2. Compact and Lightweight Design: Crop sensor cameras tend to be smaller and lighter than their full frame counterparts, making them more portable and easier to carry around for extended periods. This reduced camera body size and camera weight can be a significant advantage for travel, street, and outdoor photography. 3. Cost-Effective: Crop sensor cameras and their associated lenses are generally more affordable than their full frame equivalents, making them an attractive option for those on a tighter budget or just starting their photography journey. The smaller lens size also contributes to the overall cost savings.IMAGE QUALITY COMPARISON: FULL FRAME VS CROPPED SENSORWhen it comes to image quality, full frame cameras undoubtedly have an edge over their cropped sensor counterparts. The larger full frame sensor allows for better light-gathering capabilities, resulting in superior dynamic range, colour depth, light sensitivity, and low-light performance. However, advancements in sensor technology have narrowed the gap, and modern crop sensor cameras can produce exceptional image quality, especially in well-lit conditions. The difference in megapixels between the two sensor types has also become less significant in recent years.DEPTH OF FIELD AND LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE: FULL FRAME VS CROPPED SENSOROne of the most notable advantages of full frame cameras is their ability to achieve a shallower depth of field at the same aperture and focal length settings compared to crop sensor cameras. This characteristic is highly prized in portrait and product photography, where a beautifully blurred background can isolate the subject and create a visually stunning effect.Additionally, full frame sensors excel in low-light situations due to their larger photosites and superior light-gathering capabilities. This allows for cleaner images with less noise (noise reduction), even at higher ISO settings (high ISO sensitivity and ISO performance), making full frame cameras a preferred choice for event, wedding, and astrophotography.CROP FACTOR AND FOCAL LENGTH EQUIVALENCEThe crop factor is a term used to describe the difference between full frame and crop sensor cameras in terms of effective focal length. For example, an APS-C sensor with a crop factor of 1.6x means that a 50mm lens on that camera will have an effective focal length of 80mm (50mm x 1.6) when compared to a full frame sensor.This crop factor can be advantageous for photographers who require longer focal lengths, such as those shooting sports photography, wildlife photography, or action. The increased telephoto reach can be achieved without the need for expen of 80mm (50mm x 1.6) when compared to a full frame sensor.This crop factor can be advantageous for photographers who require longer focal lengths, such as those shooting sports photography, wildlife photography, or action. The increased telephoto reach can be achieved without the need for expensive long lenses. However, it can also be a limitation for those who prefer wider angles (wide-angle photography), as they may need to invest in specialized ultra-wide lenses to achieve the desired field of view.PRICE CONSIDERATIONS: FULL FRAME VS CROPPED SENSOROne of the most significant factors influencing the choice between full frame and crop sensor cameras is the cost. Full frame cameras and their associated lenses tend to be more expensive than their cropped sensor counterparts. This price difference can be substantial, especially for professional-grade equipment.However, it's important to consider the long-term investment and potential return on investment. While crop sensor cameras may be more affordable initially, the need to upgrade to specialised lenses or invest in a full frame camera system later on could offset the initial cost savings.LENS COMPATIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY: FULL FRAME VS CROPPED SENSORWhen it comes to lens selection and availability, full frame cameras have a distinct advantage. Most camera manufacturers offer a wider range of lenses designed specifically for full frame sensors, providing greater versatility and creative options.On the other hand, crop sensor cameras are often limited to lenses designed for their specific sensor size or compatible with full frame lenses with potential vignetting or cropping issues. This can be a significant consideration for photographers who require specialized lenses or plan to expand their lens collection in the future. The lens size comparison between full frame and crop sensor systems is also worth noting, as full frame lenses tend to be larger and heavier.CHOOSING THE RIGHT CAMERA FOR YOUR NEEDSUltimately, the choice between a full frame camera or crop sensor camera boils down to your specific needs, shooting style, and budget. If you prioritize exceptional image quality, low-light performance, and shallow depth of field, a full frame camera may be the way to go. However, if portability, affordability, and the ability to capture distant subjects with effective focal length magnification are more important, a crop sensor camera could be the better option.It's also worth considering the type of photography you primarily engage in. For instance, a full frame camera may be the preferred choice for professional portrait, landscape photography, or commercial photographers, while a crop sensor camera could be more suitable for sports photography, wildlife photography, or travel photographers.FULL-FRAME VS CROPPED SENSOR: 1-PAGE FIELD CHECKLISTDownload the printable A4 guide: crop factor, DoF equivalence, reach vs noise, when to choose each.Download Sensor Sizes Checklist (PDF) 1-to-1 Zoom Help Prefer a text link?

From tripods to camera bags, each accessory plays a crucial role in enhancing the photographer's ability to shoot in challenging environments. The right tools protect equipment and open up creative possibilities. Preparation and adaptability are key to successful outdoor photography.This article explains what I consider the top 7 essential camera accessories for a photography trip. It’s not an exhaustive list, but after fifteen years of being an outdoor photographer, it's my bare essential list. 1. LENSESIn outdoor photography, lenses serve as the eyes through which photographers capture the world's beauty. They have a profound impact on the composition, perspective, and overall storytelling ability of an image. The lens choice can dramatically alter how a landscape is perceived, making it a crucial decision for any outdoor enthusiast wielding a camera.WIDE-ANGLE LENSWide-angle lenses, typically with focal lengths under 35mm, are often the first choice for landscape photographers. These lenses offer an expansive view, allowing photographers to capture breathtaking seascapes, landscapes, and cityscapes in full glory. They excel at showcasing the grandeur of nature, creating a sense of depth and scale tha ngths under 35mm, are often the first choice for landscape photographers. These lenses offer an expansive view, allowing photographers to capture breathtaking seascapes, landscapes, and cityscapes in full glory. They excel at showcasing the grandeur of nature, creating a sense of depth and scale that draws viewers into the scene.TELEPHOTO LENSWhile wide-angle lenses dominate landscape photography, telephoto lenses are also essential in the outdoor photographer's kit. These lenses, typically 70mm to 200mm and beyond, allow photographers to zoom in on distant subjects, isolate specific elements within a landscape, and create intimate, abstract compositions.The 70-200mm range is remarkably versatile, allowing photographers to capture broad scenes and detailed close-ups. Many photographers opt for the f/4 version of this lens for landscape work, as it's lighter.PRIME LENSWith their fixed focal lengths, prime lenses offer exceptional sharpness and optical quality. The 50mm prime, often called the \"nifty fifty,\" is a popular choice for its versatility and ability to closely mimic human vision. While not traditionally associated with landscape photography, prime lenses can encourage photographers to think more creatively about their compositions and move around to find the perfect shot.Ultimately, the lens choice depends on the photographer's vision and the story they wish to tell. Whether it's a wide-angle lens to capture sweeping vistas, a telephoto to isolate distant details, or a prime lens to encourage creative framing, each has its place in the outdoor photographer's toolkit.LENS CLEANING KITA lens cleaning kit is an essential camera accessory for maintaining clear, high-quality images in outdoor settings. Dust, dirt, and moisture can accumulate on lenses, affecting image quality. A comprehensive cleaning kit typically includes:1. Microfibre cloth2. Lens cleaning solution3. Blower4. BrushRegular cleaning not only preserves image quality but also extends the life of expensive lenses. When venturing into rugged environments, a cleaning kit becomes even more crucial, allowing photographers to quickly address any debris or smudges that may compromise their shots.LENS HOODA lens hood serves as a crucial first line of defence against both light and physical elements. It helps prevent lens flare and protects the front element from rain droplets and accidental bumps.Remember, the best camera protection strategy combines multiple elements. A quality bag for transport, a reliable rain cover for wet conditions, and a lens hood for everyday shooting form a comprehensive defence system for your precious gear.----------------------------------------2. TRIPODSIn outdoor and landscape photography, a tripod is an indispensable tool for capturing the world's beauty with precision and clarity. It serves as the photographer's steadfast companion, providing stability for pin-sharp images and opening up a world of creative possibilities.TRIPOD FEATURESThe best tripods offer a delicate balance of stability, portability, and versatility. Carbon fibre has emerged as the material of choice for many photographers, offering superior dampening of vibrations and lighter weight compared to aluminium alternatives. However, this comes at a premium price point.Modern tripods often feature four or five-section legs, allowing for a shorter folded length and in merged as the material of choice for many photographers, offering superior dampening of vibrations and lighter weight compared to aluminium alternatives. However, this comes at a premium price point.Modern tripods often feature four or five-section legs, allowing for a shorter folded length and increased portability. Anti-twist leg locks and independent leg angles provide quick setup and adaptability to uneven terrain. A centre column that can be extended, angled, or inverted offers additional flexibility, particularly for macro photography.TRIPOD RECOMMENDATIONSThe C3770TN Benro Combination Tripod with the GD3WH Geared Head has become my default setup in workshops. The 3-Legged Thing Winston 2.0 also impresses with its ability to adapt to numerous configurations while folding down to just 61cm for transport.Travel enthusiasts might appreciate the Benro Rhino Series , a full-size tripod that's relatively lightweight. The Benro Rhino Series tripods are a perfect blend of strength and portability. Made from carbon fiber, they feature a built-in monopod, twist-lock leg sections, a ball head, a carrying case, and removable spikes for added stability on various surfaces.TRIPOD PRICINGTripod prices range from budget-friendly options to high-end professional gear. While it's tempting to opt for inexpensive models, investing in a quality tripod pays dividends in the long run. Mid-range tripods, priced around £250 often provide an excellent balance of performance and value for most landscape photographers.When considering price, it's crucial to assess your specific needs. A £400 tripod will likely outperform a £150 model, but the latter may be more than adequate for many photographers. Remember, the best tripod is one that meets your requirements but provides the stability and protection of your expensive camera body and lens. Would you really mount a camera and lens costing c£1k-£2k on a tripod costing £75?REMOTE SHUTTER RELEASETo further minimise camera shake, a remote shutter release proves invaluable. This accessory allows photographers to trigger the camera without physically touching it, eliminating even the slightest vibrations that might occur when pressing the shutter button. Some people prefer to use their smartphone to fire the shutter, but keep in mind you will need to install the manufacturer app beforehand to connect the phone to the camera, and excessive use will drain the battery quickly.----------------------------------------3. FILTERSIn outdoor photography, filters serve as essential camera accessories for capturing the world's beauty with precision and creativity. These thin pieces of glass or resin, when attached to the front of a camera lens, have a profound impact on image quality and artistic expression.NEUTRAL DENSITY FILTERSNeutral Density (ND) filters are the unsung heroes of daytime photography. They reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing photographers to control longer exposure in bright conditions. This capability opens up a world of c ge quality and artistic expression.NEUTRAL DENSITY FILTERSNeutral Density (ND) filters are the unsung heroes of daytime photography. They reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing photographers to control longer exposure in bright conditions. This capability opens up a world of creative possibilities:1. Long exposures: Create silky-smooth water effects or streaking clouds across the sky.2. Shallow depth of field: Use wider apertures with longer exposure time in bright sunlight without overexposing the image.3. Panning shots: Capture motion blur while maintaining proper exposure.ND filters have various strengths, with 3-stop, 6-stop, and 10-stop being the most common. The choice depends on the desired effect and lighting conditions.POLARISING FILTERSPolarising filters are the magicians of the filter world, transforming ordinary scenes into vibrant masterpieces. They selectively filter light waves, resulting in:1. Vivid colours: Skies become a deeper blue, and foliage appears more lush.2. Reduced reflections: Eliminate glare from water surfaces and wet rocks.3. Enhanced contrast: Add texture to clouds and bring out rich tones in the landscape.To use a polarising filter, simply rotate it until the desired effect is achieved. The impact is most noticeable when shooting at a 90-degree angle to the sun.GRADUATED FILTERSGraduated Neutral Density (GND) filters are the problem-solvers of landscape photography. They help balance exposure across high-contrast scenes, typically darkening the sky while leaving the foreground untouched. Available in soft-edge, hard-edge, and reverse variations, they offer flexibility for different landscape compositions.GND filters are particularly useful for:1. Sunset and sunrise shots: Capture detail in both the bright sky and darker foreground.2. Mountain landscapes: Balance snow-capped peaks with shadowed valleys.3. Seascapes: Properly expose both the sky and water in a single frame.By mastering the use of these filters , outdoor photographers can elevate their craft, capturing images that truly reflect the beauty and drama of the natural world.----------------------------------------4. CAMERA BAGFor outdoor photography, a weather-sealed camera bag stands as an indispensable accessory. It serves as a protective fortress for valuable gear, shielding it from the unpredictable elements that nature often throws at photographers. Whether traversing rugged terrains or capturing breathtaking landscapes, a robust camera bag ensures that equipment remains safe and accessible.CAMERA BAG FEATURESThe ideal camera bag for outdoor photography boasts several key features:1. Weather resistance: A tough outer shell made of ripstop, water-resistant fabric protects gear from rain, dust, and harsh conditions.2.

RAIN COVERSRain covers are the unsung heroes of outdoor photography, allowing shooters to continue their craft even in inclement weather. Many camera backpacks come with built-in rain covers.The Think Tank Emergency Rain Cover offers a quick and affordable solution, easily deployable when unexpected showers strike. The Think Tank Hydrophobia series provides comprehensive coverage for those requiring more robust protection, including a front element cover and an integrated camera strap. Or you can opt for, as I do, a large polythene bag that is inexpensive and can be used efficiently to quickly cover the lens and camera body----------------------------------------6. POWER AND STORAGEReliable power and ample storage are essential for capturing breathtaking moments without interruption. These elements allow photographers to immerse themselves fully in their craft, free from concerns about battery depletion or running out of space for their shots.EXTRA BATTERIESSpare batteries are a must-have accessory for any outdoor photographer. The last thing one wants is to run out of power just as they're getting started. Modern mirrorless cameras, while powerful, often have shorter battery life compared to their DSLR counterparts.Having multiple fully charged batteries ensures uninterrupted shooting, especially during extended outdoor sessions. I recommend a minimum of two batteries for a full day of shooting and three if you are shooting from sunrise to sunset and doing long exposure photography.MEMORY CARDSMultiple memory cards are crucial for outdoor photography. When venturing to out-of-the-way locations, photographers often want to capture numerous high-quality images. Memory cards can fill up faster than expected, particularly when shooting in RAW format or capturing 4K video. It's advisable to carry several high-capacity, fast-writing SD cards to ensure ample storage throughout the shoot or the dreaded rare eventuality of a card be",

That’s a depth of field (DoF) problem, not a “bad lens.” This lesson shows how to set DoF on purpose so attention lands exactly where you want it. * What DoF is: the zone that appears acceptably sharp around your focus distance. * What controls it: aperture (f-number), subject distance, focal length — plus how large you view/print the image. * How to use it: isolate a subject with shallow DoF, or make everything sharp with stopped-down apertures and smart focus placement (hyperfocal).3 key takeaways 1. Pick your look first: shallow for portraits (background blur), deep for landscapes (front-to-back detail). 2. Use the three levers: open/close the aperture, move closer/farther, or change focal length to grow/shrink DoF. 3. Place focus deliberately: on the nearest eye for people; for landscapes, focus a little beyond the nearest important detail or use hyperfocal for maximum depth.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------WHAT IS DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHY: A BEGINNERS GUIDEMastering the intricate concept of depth of field in photography marks a pivotal moment Understanding depth of field in photography is a crucial step in a pho ----------------------WHAT IS DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHY: A BEGINNERS GUIDEMastering the intricate concept of depth of field in photography marks a pivotal moment Understanding depth of field in photography is a crucial step in a photographer's journey towards capturing compelling images. The depth of field concept not only enhances the sharpness and focus of a photograph but also plays a crucial role in controlling the aesthetic appeal of the background and foreground, giving life to images with desired blur and bokeh or highlighting the stark sharpness in landscape photography. This foundational skill influences how photographers use camera settings, f-stop, and focal length to articulate their creative vision, making it indispensable in macro photography, portrait photography, and beyond.The forthcoming sections of this understanding depth of field in photography guide are designed to equip photographers with a comprehensive understanding This article explores the depth of field and its impact on photography. Readers will delve into the factors affecting depth of field, including aperture, focal length, and the role of diffraction, and learn how adjustments in camera settings can manipulate the extent of sharpness and blur in an image. Examples and applications will illustrate the practical implementation of these concepts in various photography genres, further enriched by advanced tips and techniques to refine control over depth of field. Through this exploration, photographers will unlock new dimensions of creativity in their work, leveraging the power of depth of field to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.WHAT IS DEPTH OF FIELD? - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYDEPTH OF FIELD — WHAT CONTROLS IT & HOW TO USE ITDepth of Field (DoF) is the zone that appears acceptably sharp around your focus distance.

Landscape (tripod) f/8–f/11 Slightly beyond nearest important detail Prefer hyperfocal if maximum depth needed; avoid f/22 unless required. Macro / close-up f/8–f/16 Critical detail (eye/stamen) DoF is tiny—align subject with focus plane or use focus stacking.Tip: At moderate distances, DoF often extends slightly more behind than in front of the focus plane (not a fixed 1/3–2/3 rule). Use the histogram/magnified review to confirm.View fullsizeDEPTH OF FIELD MEANING - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYDepth of field (DoF) is a crucial concept in photography that refers to the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a photo that appears acceptably sharp. This area of sharpness is confined to the exact point of focus but extends in front of and behind the focus point, comprising a zone where everything appears clearly defined. Understanding what is depth of field in photography is essential for mastering this aspect.UNDERSTANDING THE ZONE OF SHARPNESS - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYThe zone of sharpness, or depth of field, varies depending on several key factors. At its core, depth of field can be described as either narrow or large. Depth of field examples can help illustrate these variations. Only a small portion of the image A shallow depth of field, typically around the focus point, will appear sharp, creating a blurred background useful for isolating the subject from its surroundings. This effect is often employed in portrait photography or to diminish distracting backgrounds. Conversely, a considerable depth of field captures a greater area in focus, which is ideal for landscape photography, where the clarity of the entire scene is desired.FACTORS INFLUENCING DEPTH OF FIELD - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYView fullsizeThe primary factors that photographers can adjust to control the depth of field include aperture, focal length, and the distance to the subject. Understanding aperture and depth of field is crucial for achieving the desired effect. * Aperture: This is the opening in the lens diaphragm through which light passes. A wider aperture (lower f-number) decreases the depth of field A larger aperture (lower f-number) decreases the depth of field, rendering a more pronounced blurred background. Conversely, a smaller aperture (higher f-number) increases the depth of field, bringing more of the scene into focus. * Focal Length: The length of the lens also affects DoF. Shorter focal lengths (wider lenses) tend to increase the depth of field, while longer focal lengths (telephoto lenses) reduce it, making it easier to achieve a blurred background. * Distance to Subject: The closer the subject is to the camera, the narrower the depth of field As the distance from the subject increases, the depth of field becomes wider, allowing more of the scene to be in focus.PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF DEPTH OF FIELD - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYUnderstanding and manipulating depth of field allows photographers to achieve specific aesthetic effects in their images. Whether the goal is to highlight a subject by blurring the background or to capture every detail of a sweeping landscape, mastering depth of field is essential for producing visually compelling photographs. Adjusting the camera settings such as aperture, focal length, and subject distance provides photographers with creative control over what elements remain sharp and which fade into soft blurs. Depth of field control and adjustment are key to artistic photography.INTERACTIVE: EXPOSURE CALCULATOROpen full screen or open in a new tab FACTORS AFFECTING DEPTH OF FIELD - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYAPERTURE (F-STOP)The aperture, or f-stop, is a crucial element in controlling the depth of field in photography. It refers to the size of the opening in the lens through which light passes. A larger aperture (represented by a smaller f-stop number, such as f/1.8) allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a shallower depth of field. This setting is ideal for portraits where the subject needs to stand out against a blurred background. Conversely, a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number, like f/22) lets in less light, which increases the depth of field and keeps more of the scene in focus, suitable for landscape photography. Understanding aperture and depth of field is essential for mastering photographic techniques.DISTANCE BETWEEN YOUR LENS AND YOUR SUBJECTThe distance to the subject plays a significant role in the appearance of depth of field. The closer the camera is to the subject, the shallower the depth of field becomes, making the background blur more pronounced. This technique is often used in macro photography or when the subject needs to be isolated from its surroundings. On the other hand, increasing the distance between the camera and the subject broadens the depth of field, allowing more of the scene to be in focus, which is beneficial in group photos or wide landscapes. Adjusting the focus distance is key to achieving the desired effect.FOCAL LENGTHFocal length, measured in millimeters, directly affects the depth of field. Shorter focal lengths (wide-angle lenses) tend to have a deeper depth of field, making them ideal for capturing expansive landscapes where the photographer desires clarity throughout the image. Longer focal lengths (telephoto lenses), however, narrow the depth of field, which can beautifully blur the background while focusing sharply on the subject, commonly used in portrait photography. Selecting the appropriate lens fo ndscapes where the photographer desires clarity throughout the image. Longer focal lengths (telephoto lenses), however, narrow the depth of field, which can beautifully blur the background while focusing sharply on the subject, commonly used in portrait photography. Selecting the appropriate lens focal length is crucial for achieving the desired depth of field.SENSOR SIZESensor size also influences the depth of field, although indirectly. Cameras with larger sensors (full-frame) Full frame cameras tend to have a shallower depth of field at the same aperture setting compared to those with smaller sensors (crop sensors). This characteristic allows for greater background blur, enhancing the aesthetic quality of portraits and close-up shots. Conversely, smaller sensors provide a deeper depth of field, which is advantageous for capturing detailed scenes with everything in focus, such as in landscape photography. Understanding camera sensor size is essential for selecting the right equipment for your photography needs.HOW TO ADJUST AND CONTROL DEPTH OF FIELD - UNDERSTANDING DEPTH OF FIELD IN PHOTOGRAPHYUSING APERTURE PRIORITY OR MANUAL MODEView fullsizeTo begin adjusting and controlling the depth of field in photography, one must first select the appropriate camera mode. For beginners, understanding depth of field control is crucial for achieving the desired photographic effects. Aperture Priority mode Aperture Priority mode is recommended as it allows the photographer to set the aperture, while the camera automatically determines the best shutter speed for optimal exposure. More advanced photographers may prefer Manual mode, which offers the freedom to select both the aperture and shutter speed independently, granting greater creative control over the image. Aperture Priority mode is particularly useful for quickly adjusting the depth of field without having to manually balance the exposure settings. Utilising the depth of field preview feature can also help in visualising the final image.CALCULATING HYPERFOCAL DISTANCE QUICK TIPS — HYPERFOCAL DISTANCE * What it does: focus at the hyperfocal distance (H) and depth of field runs from about H/2 to ∞ — ideal for landscapes. * Formula (mm): H ≈ (f²) / (N × c) + f f = focal length (mm) · N = f-number · c = circle of confusion (sensor): FF≈0.03 mm, APS-C≈0.02 mm, MFT≈0.015 mm. * Example (full-frame): 24 mm at f/11 → H ≈ 24²/(11×0.03) + 24 = 576/0.33 + 24 ≈ 1769 mm → 1.77 m. Near limit ≈ 0.89 m, far = ∞. * Quick references: * 16 mm · f/8 · FF: H ≈ 1.08 m (near ≈ 0.54 m) * 18 mm · f/8 · APS-C: H ≈ 2.04 m (near ≈ 1.02 m) * How to use in the field: set your aperture (often f/8–f/11), measure/estimate H, focus at H (use lens scale or AF on an object at that distance), then switch to MF and recompose. * If no distance scale: walk to roughly H, AF on a rock/pole there, switch to MF, walk back and shoot. * Verify: magnified review of the nearest important detail (≈H/2). If soft, nudge focus slightly closer or stop down 1 stop. * Accuracy note: “acceptable sharp” depends on output size. For big prints or dense sensors, use a smaller CoC (or stop down 1 stop) for extra safety.QUICK TIPS — EASY ALTERNATIVES TO HYPERFOCAL (NO CALCU",

It will delve into image quality and sensor technology, comparing the capabilities of both systems to answer the question: is mirrorless better than DSLR? The piece will also examine autofocus performance, size and weight considerations, and ergonomics to highlight the difference between mirrorless and DSLR. By the end, readers will have a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each camera type, helping them make an informed decision about which system - DSLR or mirrorless - might be best for their photographic needs.IMAGE QUALITY AND SENSOR TECHNOLOGY: DSLR CAMERA VS MIRRORLESSWhen it comes to image quality and sensor understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each camera type, helping them make an informed decision about which system - DSLR or mirrorless - might be best for their photographic needs.IMAGE QUALITY AND SENSOR TECHNOLOGY: DSLR CAMERA VS MIRRORLESSWhen it comes to image quality and sensor technology in the comparison of DSLR v mirrorless, both types of cameras utilise APS-C sensors and full-frame sensors, with the newest mirrorless cameras outperforming DSLRs in terms of low-light performance, resolution, and speed. Although DSLR sensors were impressive for their time, mirrorless cameras are now leading the way in sensor innovation.SENSOR TYPES AND SIZESDSLRs traditionally feature larger image sensors, such as APS-C or full-frame sensors , which can result in excellent image quality, especially in low-light conditions. These sensors provide high dynamic range and low noise levels , contributing to superior image quality. However, mirrorless cameras also utilise APS-C and full-frame sensors, with the latest models surpassing DSLRs in terms of performance.DYNAMIC RANGEDynamic range refers to the ability of a camera to capture both bright and dark areas in a scene. Mirrorless cameras have made significant strides in this area, with many models offering improved dynamic range compared to their DSLR counterparts. This allows for greater flexibility in post-processing and the ability to recover more detail in highlights and shadows.LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCELow light performance is a crucial aspect for many photographers, particularly those shooting concerts or other dimly lit events. DSLRs can comfortably shoot up to ISO 3200 (or 6400 in some cases) before noise becomes too noticeable. In contrast, mirrorless cameras can shoot at ISO 6400 (or even 12800 with the Sony A7Siii) before noise becomes an issue, showcasing their superior performance in the mirrorless vs DSLR camera comparison.Mirrorless cameras also feature advanced autofocus systems with low-light capabilities, providing fast and accurate focusing even in challenging lighting conditions. When combined with their increased high ISO performance, mirrorless cameras have a distinct advantage when shooting in low light.While DSLR lenses are often available at lower prices, fast prime lenses (f/1.4 or f/1.2) for low-light shooting are also available for mirrorless cameras, albeit at a higher cost.In summary, while DSLRs have traditionally been known for their image quality and low-light performance, mirrorless cameras have not only caught up but have surpassed them in many aspects. With advanced sensor technology, improved dynamic range, and superior low-light capabilities, mirrorless cameras are now the preferred choice for photographers seeking the best possible image quality in the mirrorless vs mirror camera debate.AUTOFOCUS CAPABILITIES: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DSLR AND MIRRORLESS?When it comes to autofocus performance and the difference between mirrorless and DSLR, mirrorless cameras have a distinct advantage over DSLRs. While DSLRs rely on a separate phase detection autofocus module, mirrorless cameras utilise sensor-based autofocus systems that offer faster and more accurate focusing.PHASE DETECTION VS CONTRAST DETECTIONDSLRs use a dedicated phase detection autofocus module, which s rely on a separate phase detection autofocus module, mirrorless cameras utilise sensor-based autofocus systems that offer faster and more accurate focusing.PHASE DETECTION VS CONTRAST DETECTIONDSLRs use a dedicated phase detection autofocus module, which is fast but can be prone to calibration issues. In contrast, mirrorless cameras employ a combination of phase detection and contrast detection autofocus directly on the sensor. This hybrid approach allows for more precise focusing, especially when using wide apertures, highlighting a key difference between DSLR and mirrorless.Mirrorless cameras also benefit from having phase detection autofocus points spread across a larger area of the sensor, providing better coverage and improved subject-tracking capabilities. Some high-end mirrorless cameras, such as the Sony A7R V, feature advanced autofocus systems with a high number of phase detection points for exceptional performance.EYE DETECTION AND FACE DETECTIONOne of the standout features of mirrorless cameras is their advanced eye-detection and face-detection capabilities. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, mirrorless cameras can accurately detect and track human and animal eyes, ensuring sharp focus even when the subject is moving.This technology is beneficial for portrait, wedding, and pet photography, where maintaining focus on the subject's eyes is crucial. Many mirrorless cameras, including the Sony A7 IV, offer reliable eye and face detection that can significantly improve the accuracy and consistency of focus.LOW LIGHT FOCUSINGMirrorless cameras generally outperform DSLRs when it comes to low-light focusing. The sensor-based autofocus systems in mirrorless cameras can detect contrast and focus accurately, even in dimly lit situations.Additionally, the electronic viewfinder in mirrorless cameras can boost the brightness of the scene, making it easier to compose and focus in low-light conditions. This is a significant advantage over the optical viewfinder found in DSLRs, which can be challenging to use in low light, further emphasizing the difference between mirrorless and DSLR cameras.Autofocus FeatureMirrorless CamerasDSLRsAF SystemHybrid (Phase Detection + Contrast Detection)Separate Phase Detection ModuleAF Point CoverageWide, across the sensorLimited, clustered in the centreEye Detection & Face DetectionAdvanced, AI-poweredLimited or not availableLow Light FocusingExcellent, thanks to sensor-based AF and electronic viewfinderStruggles due to separate AF module and optical viewfinderIn summary, mirrorless cameras have a clear edge when it comes to autofocus capabilities. With their hybrid autofocus systems, advanced eye detection and face detection, and superior low light focusing, mirrorless cameras offer photographers a more reliable and efficient focusing experience compared to traditional DSLRs, making them a compelling choice in the mirrorless dslr debate.SIZE, WEIGHT AND ERGONOMICS: MIRRORLESS VS MIRROR CAMERAWhen it comes to camera size and weight in the mirrorless vs mirror camera comparison, mirrorless cameras generally have an advantage over DSLRs. The absence of a mirror mechanism allows for a more compact camera body design. This makes mirrorless cameras ideal for travel photography and situations where portability is essential.However, as sensor sizes in mirrorless cameras have increased, with APS-C sensors and full-frame sensors DSLRs. The absence of a mirror mechanism allows for a more compact camera body design. This makes mirrorless cameras ideal for travel photography and situations where portability is essential.However, as sensor sizes in mirrorless cameras have increased, with APS-C sensors and full-frame sensors becoming more common, the size advantage has somewhat diminished. While the camera bodies may still be smaller, the lenses required for these larger sensors can be quite substantial in size and weight.BODY DIMENSIONSMirrorless cameras, especially those with smaller sensors like Micro Four Thirds, tend to be more compact and lightweight compared to their DSLR counterparts.

The allure of capturing the beauty of nature, particularly in woodlands, has becom our mental health and well-being are well documented by spending time in woodlands and forests.\"WOODLAND PICTURESWoodland photography is not just a hobby; it's a passion that has consumed me for over a decade. The allure of capturing the beauty of nature, particularly in woodlands, has become an integral part of my life, fueling my forest photography ideas. And it's not just about aesthetics; there's a scientific basis behind the positive impact of spending time in these natural settings on our well-being.Numerous studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of nature, particularly woodlands and forests. This concept is so valued in Japan that they have a term for it: \"forest bathing\" or shinrin-yoku. It involves mindfully and intentionally spending time in wooded areas to reduce stress, boost mood, and enhance overall well-being through the therapeutic benefits of nature.Forest bathing has gained recognition worldwide, with many embracing its principles and experiencing its positive effects firsthand. The calming effect of being surrounded by trees, the gentle rustling of leaves, and the earthy scent of the forest can evoke a sense of peace and tranquillity, offering stress relief and fostering a deeper connection with nature.As an avid woodland photographer, I have experienced the profound impact of spending time in these natural havens. With every click of the shutter, I capture not just images but also moments of serenity and inspiration. Observing and framing nature's wonders through the lens brings me profound joy and fulfilment.In 2024, I am committed to deepening my engagement with UK woodland photography, venturing into ancient woodlands and forests across the UK, such as the iconic Sherwood Forest and the ancient Welsh woods. My goal is to uncover the hidden gems within these woodlands and immortalise their unique beauty through my lens, from the storied grandeur of Sherwood Forest to the enchanting Welsh ancient oak and birch woodlands, each with a character all its own to be captured and cherished.Through my photography, I aim to do more than display the splendour of woodlands; I aspire to heighten awareness about their conservation and underscore their ecosystem importance. These natural havens are crucial for the planet's health and nurturing our emotional well-being and inner peace.In conclusion, my woodland photography journey has profoundly transformed me, enriching me personally and artistically. It has become a source of solace and inspiration, fostering a profound bond with nature and offering therapeutic benefits. As I delve into the enchanting realm of woodlands, I aspire to encourage others to discover these natural marvels through my woodland pictures.In this article, I am eager to divulge my photography tips and tricks, tailored explicitly to capture the essence of woodlands and create stunning forest photos.UNDERSTANDING LIGHT IN THE WOODLANDLight, the lifeblood of photography and particularly crucial in woodland light scenarios, is essential for crafting captivating images. Light morphs into various guises in the woodland, from the gentle, diffused glow of early morning to the stark, contrasty beams of midday. Mastering the nuances of light in photography will empower you to set distinct moods and articulate your artistic vision with clarity and impact.EMBRACING DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONSIn woodland photography, adapting to the varying lighting conditions is vital to express rasty beams of midday. Mastering the nuances of light in photography will empower you to set distinct moods and articulate your artistic vision with clarity and impact.EMBRACING DIFFERENT LIGHTING CONDITIONSIn woodland photography, adapting to the varying lighting conditions is vital to expressing your artistic vision. Each type of light, the balanced illumination of an overcast day or the stark drama of morning sun shadows, presents its narrative possibilities and aesthetic challenges, infusing each image with its unique allure.Consider two contrasting examples to demonstrate the dramatic effects of different lighting conditions. The first, taken on an overcast day, showcases the subtle nuances of overcast light with a gentle contrast that softens the landscape. The second, captured with the morning sun just above the horizon, is bathed in a warm glow, accentuating the interplay of light and shadows and creating a striking visual narrative.It is crucial to understand that there are no absolute 'right' or 'wrong' choices when it comes to lighting in woodland photography. It's about selecting the lighting that enhances the photography styles and colour schemes you're aiming to showcase in your images. If you're committed to a specific aesthetic, you might adhere to precise guidelines regarding the times and conditions for your shoots. Nevertheless, welcoming a variety of lighting conditions can lead to a more varied and dynamic portfolio.CREATING DEPTH AND ATMOSPHERE WITH FOGAmong the most cherished conditions for woodland photographers is the enchanting presence of fog or mist. Mist photography, especially in the early morning, acts as a natural diffuser, softly tempering the light as it filters through the trees and imparting a mystical atmosphere to the trunks. Fog adds depth to the scene and creates a smooth transition from light to shadow, endowing the image with a surreal beauty.Capturing photographs under foggy conditions requires an appreciation of how the mist interacts with the trees and the environment. Seek out chances to capture the delicate interplay between light and shadow and the subtle colour gradients that diffused light can bring. Exploring different perspectives and viewpoints can reveal the unique charm that fog adds to the woodland setting.CREATING COMPELLING COMPOSITIONSPhotography composition is the foundation of any impactful photograph, and mastering your skills in this area for woodland photography is essential. A meticulously composed shot can captivate the viewer, stir emotions, and convey a compelling narrative. Here are some strategies to aid you in crafting exceptional photography compositions in the forest.ISOLATION: EMPHASISING THE BEAUTY OF INDIVIDUAL TREESThe isolation technique is a potent method that allows you to accentuate the beauty of individual trees amidst the dense woodland. By focusing on a tree that contrasts with its surroundings, you can produce visually striking images that celebrate your subject's distinctive character and structure.To achieve subject isolation, scout for trees with unique features, such as intriguing shapes, textures, or colours. Pay attention to the tree's placement in the frame and utilise techniques like shallow depth of field or selective focus to ensure the subject stands out against the backdrop. Isolation can be further highlighted by atmospheric elements like fog, which provides separation and enhances the image's depth.FRAM to the tree's placement in the frame and utilise techniques like shallow depth of field or selective focus to ensure the subject stands out against the backdrop. Isolation can be further highlighted by atmospheric elements like fog, which provides separation and enhances the image's depth.FRAMING: ADDING DEPTH AND CONTEXT TO YOUR IMAGESThe framing technique involves using elements within the scene to encircle your subject, adding depth and context to your photographs. In woodland photography, you can use the surrounding trees, branches, or foliage as natural frames to direct the viewer's gaze towards the focal point.To master framing in photography, particularly within the context of woodland scenes, seek out captivating foreground elements that can serve as a natural frame. Position yourself strategically so the frame guides the viewer's eye to the subject, creating depth and immersion in your woodland images. Explore various angles and perspectives to uncover the most effective options that amplify the visual impact of your photos through framing in photography.BUILDING COMPOSITIONS: SEEKING BALANCE AND HARMONYCreating a harmonious composition in woodland photography requires thoughtful consideration of how different elements within the frame interact. Look beyond individual trees and strive to capture the unity and balance among groups of trees, which contributes to a cohesive sense of a harmonious composition in your images.When building composition photography, it's crucial to ask yourself: What is the image's main focus? How can I eliminate distractions to establish a clear focal point? How does the light influence the scene, and how can I position myself to make the most of it? By evaluating the scene and making deliberate compositional choices, you can craft images that are aesthetically appealing and rich in storytelling through composition photography.SCOUTING: UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE WOODLANDScouting for photography is a vital component of successful woodland photography, which can significantly improve your chances of capturing stunning images. By getting to know the area, researching potential spots, and understanding the woodland's unique features, you can uncover creative opportunities and increase your chances of photographing remarkable scenes through effective scouting for photography.THOROUGHLY EXPLORE THE WOODLANDTo truly grasp the essence of woodland and uncover its hidden gems, dedicate time and effort to thorough woodland exploration. Revisit the area at various times throughout the day and across different seasons to observe the dynamic conditions and lighting. Keep an eye out for unique features such as distinctive tree formations, intriguing patterns, or enchanting natural elements that could become the highlight of your photographs, enhancing your woodland exploration experience.Leverage online tools like Google Maps to pinpoint new woodland areas for your photographic adventures. Additionally, peruse photography platforms like Flickr to view images captured in those woodlands. This research can provide a glimpse of what to anticipate and can ignite your creative vision for future sessions, enriching your use of photography platforms for inspiration. Enclosed below a custom Google Map I created for my woodland photography walks around Warwickshire.TAKE REFERENCE IMAGES AND NOTESOn scouting excursions, capture reference images and make notes to sessions, enriching your use of photography platforms for inspiration. Enclosed below a custom Google Map I created for my woodland photography walks around Warwickshire.TAKE REFERENCE IMAGES AND NOTESOn scouting excursions, capture reference images and make notes to document potential planning compositions, observe lighting conditions, and identify exciting elements. Utilise your smartphone or a notebook to record your ideas, observations, and any particular details you wish to recall for subsequent photography outings, ensuring your planning compositions are well-prepared.Reference images are an essential tool for photographers, acting as a crucial visual guide when planning compositions and helping to recreate specific lighting conditions or atmospheres that are particularly captivating. These reference images, along with detailed notes, can also serve as valuable references, reminding you of particular spots, angles, or techniques you want to explore further.BE PREPARED FOR THE RIGHT CONDITIONSWoodland photography often captures enchanting conditions, such as misty mornings or the warm glow of golden-hour light. By thoroughly scouting the area, you can become familiar with the patterns and behaviours of the woodland, which makes predicting and anticipating conditions like misty mornings more likely and easier.Pay attention to factors that influence the appearance of mist, such as nearby rivers or sources of moisture. Study the weather patterns and utilise weather apps to track potential foggy or atmospheric conditions. Being prepared and vigilant by understanding these weather patterns will significantly increase your chances of capturing stunning woodland photographs.RELAXING AND EMBRACING THE PROCESSFinding joy in photography should be a source of relaxation and a means to connect with nature and express your creativity. While woodland photography can be challenging and require patience and persistence, it's important to remember to relax and enjoy the process, allowing the joy in photography to shine through your work.LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND EMBRACE THE UNEXPECTEDSetting high expectations can lead to disappointment and frustration. Instead, adopt a mindset of exploration and experimentation, allowing yourself to be open to unexpected opportunities and creative discoveries. Be flexible and adaptable, embracing the changing conditions and finding beauty in the unexpected, which is at the heart of a mindset of exploration in photography.TAKE TIME TO APPRECIATE THE SURROUNDINGSWhile planning, scouting, and capturing images, it's easy to get caught up in the technical aspects and forget to appreciate the beauty of the woodland itself. Take moments to pause, observe, and immerse yourself in the natural surroundings. Allow yourself to be present and fully experience the magic of the woodland, as this deep connection with nature will enhance your creativity and enrich your photographs.ENJOY THE JOURNEYRemember that landscape photography is a journey of growth and self-expression. Each photograph you capture reflects your unique perspective and artistic vision. Embrace the challenges, learn from your experiences, and enjoy the journey of capturing the beauty of the woodland through your lens, as this is the essence of landscape photography.EQUIPMENT FOR WOODLAND PHOTOGRAPHYCarrying essential equipment is crucial if you want to capture the best forest pictures and cr",

The season's beauty, however, comes with its own set of challenges for winter photographers. The monochromatic scenes, unpredictable lighting, and extreme weather conditions can make winter photography a daunting task. But fear not, with the right skills and winter photography tips, you can capture the winter wonderland in all its glory. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the art of winter photography, offering tips and tricks to help you navigate the challenges and capture breathtaking images whether you are going out alone or joining my winter photo workshops or other photography events near me.winter photography tipsTIPS FOR LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY IN WINTERSECTION 1: EMBRACE WINTER LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHYWinter, with its unique beauty, offers myriad opportunities for winter photographers. The landscape is reduced in colour; the frost-laden trees and the soft, diffused light present a different perspective on the world around us. So, don't let the cold deter you. Put on your warmest clothes, pack your camera gear, and venture out into the winter wonderland. Remember, the key to successful winter photography lies in understanding and embracing the season's peculiarities.SUBSECTION 1.1: KEEP AN EYE ON THE WEATHERBefore you step out for your winter photo . Put on your warmest clothes, pack your camera gear, and venture out into the winter wonderland. Remember, the key to successful winter photography lies in understanding and embracing the season's peculiarities.SUBSECTION 1.1: KEEP AN EYE ON THE WEATHERBefore you step out for your winter photography expedition, check the forecast. Weather conditions can drastically impact the results of your shoot. A clear, sunny day will present different opportunities compared to a snowy or overcast one. Remember that the weather can change rapidly during winter, so always be prepared for the unexpected. Pack extra layers, food, and an emergency kit to ensure safety.SUBSECTION 1.2: UNDERSTAND THE LIGHTWinter brings a unique quality of light. The sun stays lower in the sky, producing long shadows and a soft, diffused light. This can add a magical touch to your winter landscapes. Understand the light conditions and plan your shoot accordingly. Early mornings and late afternoons, also known as the golden hours, can be particularly enchanting.SECTION 2: TECHNICAL TIPS FOR WINTER PHOTOGRAPHYKnowing your camera settings and how to adapt them to winter conditions is crucial. From shutter speed to exposure compensation, understanding these technical aspects can greatly enhance your winter photos.2.1: MASTERING SHUTTER SPEEDShutter speed plays a vital role in winter photography, if you are hand-holding your camera on a walk then remember the lower light levels will result in slow shutter speeds so you will need to consider opening up the aperture and, or increasing the ISO to compensate.2.2: ADJUSTING EXPOSURE COMPENSATION FOR SNOWshould you be lucky enough to have snow remember due to the reflective nature of snow, your camera's sensor might perceive the scene as overly bright and underexpose the image, making the snow appear grey. To prevent this, increase your exposure compensation to between +0.7EV and +1.7EV. This will help capture the snow's pure whiteness more effectively.2.3: NAVIGATING THE ISODuring the darker days of winter, it might be necessary to tweak your ISO settings to make up for the diminished light. However, bear in mind that escalating the ISO can lead to grainy images. Therefore, strive to strike an optimal balance between the ISO and other parameters such as shutter speed and aperture.SECTION 3: GEAR AND EQUIPMENT FOR WINTER PHOTOGRAPHYIt's vital to safeguard your equipment against the cold and dampness in winter photography. Here are some strategies to ensure your gear remains safe and operational in the frigid conditions.3.1: SPARE BATTERIES ARE ESSENTIALThe chilly weather can rapidly deplete your camera batteries. Always have backup batteries on hand and store them in your inner jacket pockets. The warmth from your body will maintain the batteries' temperature, extending their lifespan.3.2: PROTECT YOUR GEARWhen you're out in the snow, it's important to shield your camera from moisture. Dry, powdered snow won't harm your camera, but wet snow can create issues. A waterproof camera bag or cover can provide the necessary protection.3.3: ACCLIMATISE YOUR CAMERATransitioning your camera from a cold outdoor setting to a warm indoor one can lead to condensation, which can damage your camera. The most effective way to avoid this is to place your camera in a sealed bag before bringing it indoors. Allow your camera to gradually adapt to the temperature shift before removing it from the bag. a cold outdoor setting to a warm indoor one can lead to condensation, which can damage your camera. The most effective way to avoid this is to place your camera in a sealed bag before bringing it indoors. Allow your camera to gradually adapt to the temperature shift before removing it from the bag.SECTION 4: COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES FOR WINTER PHOTOGRAPHYComposition is paramount in any photography genre, and winter photography is no different. Here are some techniques to craft visually captivating and compelling images.4.1: USE COLOUR FOR CONTRASTWinter landscapes are typically monochromatic. Any burst of colour can pop and introduce a dramatic contrast to your photos. A vibrant object, like a red barn or a blue jacket, can add depth and intrigue to an otherwise white landscape.4.2: PLAY WITH PERSPECTIVEWinter provides plenty of opportunities to play with perspective. Try shooting from different angles, use a macro lens for close-ups of frost and snowflakes, or use a drone for aerial shots of the winter landscape. Experiment and be creative with your shots.4.3: UTILISE NEGATIVE SPACEThe abundance of white space in winter scenes can be used to your advantage. Use the white space to create minimalist, powerful images. Add a subject in the foreground to add depth and interest to your photos.SECTION 5: RESPECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND WILDLIFEWinter can be a challenging time for wildlife, with food sources becoming scarce. If you are photographing animals, ensure you maintain a safe distance to not disturb them. Use a zoom lens to capture high-quality images without disturbing the wildlife.SECTION 6: TEN WINTER PHOTOGRAPHY IDEAS 1. Frosty Morning: Capture the frost that clings to tree branches, plants, and fences in the early morning. The intricate patterns can create beautiful macro photography. 2. Sunrise and Sunset: Winter sunrises and sunsets often have a unique, beautiful quality, with hues that can be more dramatic and intense than in other seasons. Look for reflections in bodies of water for an added element of interest. 3. Rural Landscapes: Old farm buildings, barns, and country lanes can take on a different character in the winter months. 4. Ice Patterns: On colder days, look for patterns in the ice on bodies of water or puddles. These can create interesting abstract photos. 5. Winter Wildlife: Birds and animals in their winter settings can make for stunning photography. Remember to respect their space. 6. Winter Night Sky: The clear, cold nights of winter often provide exceptional opportunities for astrophotography. Capture the stars, moon, or even the Northern Lights if you're lucky. 7. Seascapes: The coast can be a dramatic place in winter, with rough seas and emptier beaches. The contrast of a stormy sea against a moody winter sky can be quite powerful. 8. Woodland Walks: The leafless trees of winter can provide some stark, beautiful scenes, especially when silhouetted against the winter sky. 9. Foggy Landscapes: Winter often brings foggy mornings, which can give your photos a mysterious, ethereal quality. 10. Winter Reflections: Puddles, lakes, or rivers can create beautiful reflections of the winter landscape, adding an extra dimension to your photos.Remember, winter provides some unique opportunities for landscape photography. So, bundle up, get out there, and explore the beauty of the season.SECTION 7: JOIN A WINTER PHOTO WORKSHOPI have a range of professi l reflections of the winter landscape, adding an extra dimension to your photos.Remember, winter provides some unique opportunities for landscape photography.

Personally, I prefer the term visual pathways, but that’s semantics. These lines can be human-made or natural elements within the frame that direct attention to the main subject or the heart of the photograph. As photographer Lukas Kosslow explains, \"Leading lines can be very noticeable or they can be quite subtle.\"In essence, leading lines can take various forms: 1. Roads or paths 2. Lines of trees 3. People in a queue 4. Repetitive objects like railroad tracks 5. Rivers or streams 6. Fallen treesThe versatility of leading lines allows photographers to use them creatively in different types of photography, from landscapes to portraits.QUICK TIPS — LEADING LINESField checklist * Look for roads, fences, rivers, paths or shadows that naturally guide the viewer’s eye. * Position lines to lead into the frame, not out of it. * Combine diagonals and curves to add energy and depth. * Place your subject at the end of the line for maximum impact. * Avoid clutter — lines should be clear and intentional.WHY USE LEADING LINES?Leading lines serve several crucial purposes in photography: 1. Guiding the viewer's eye: They create a visual path through the image, directing attention to specific elements. 2. Adding depth: Leading lines can create a sense of three-dimensionality, especially in landscape photography. 3. Creating flow and dynamism: They keep the viewer engaged by taking them on a journey around the photo. 4. Emphasising the subject: When used effectively, leading lines point to or converge at the main subject, highlighting its importance. 5. Imposing order: As one photographer notes, \"Leading lines can help turn your photo from a snapshot into a story. They impose a sense of order amidst the chaos of the natural world.\"COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS - LEADING LINES PHOTOGRAPHYWhile leading lines are a valuable tool, there are some common mistakes to avoid: 1. Misaligned lines: The line should lead toward the focal point. For example, if using a stream as a leading line towards a grove of trees, ensure the stream leads into the grove, not away from it. 2. Too many lines: Multiple leading lines can confuse the viewer. It's crucial to isolate the singular story of a photograph and present it clearly. 3. Contradicting the theme: Sometimes, a clear leading line might contrast ove of trees, ensure the stream leads into the grove, not away from it. 2. Too many lines: Multiple leading lines can confuse the viewer. It's crucial to isolate the singular story of a photograph and present it clearly. 3. Contradicting the theme: Sometimes, a clear leading line might contrast with the story you're trying to tell. Ensure the leading lines align with the overall theme and mood of your photo. 4. Treating them as fixed rules: While leading lines are a useful guideline, they shouldn't be seen as inflexible rules. Photography composition is a creative process that requires experimentation and adaptation to context.By understanding these basics, photographers can use leading lines to create more impactful and engaging images that tell compelling visual stories.MASTERING THE ART OF LEADING LINES COMPOSITIONView fullsizeHOW TO USE LEADING LINES IN PHOTOGRAPHYTo make the most of leading lines in photography, one can employ several techniques: 1. Experiment with different perspectives: Changing the point of view, such as shooting from a lower or higher angle, can amplify the impact of leading lines. 2. Use converging lines: Look for lines that draw the eye towards a vanishing point, creating a sense of depth and drawing attention to the main subject. 3. Incorporate S-curves and curved lines: Winding paths or roads can add elegance and flow to photographs, creating a dynamic composition. 4. Fill the frame: Experiment with filling the frame with leading lines to create a more immersive and impactful composition. 5. Utilise wide-angle lenses: These lenses allow photographers to capture expansive scenes, positioning leading lines towards the bottom of the frame and letting them flow into the shot. 6. Combine multiple leading lines: Using more than one leading line can create a stronger composition, guiding the viewer's eye more effectively towards the main subject. 7. Apply the near-far technique: This approach creates depth by incorporating a strong foreground element with leading lines that guide the eye to the background.WANT STRONGER COMPOSITIONS WITH LEADING LINES?Fix flat compositions fast.

Photographers can use different types of lines to evoke specific emotions: 1. Horizontal lines: These convey stability and are often used in landscape photography. They can create a sense of calm and tranquillity, making them ideal for peaceful nature scenes. 2. Vertical lines: These suggest power and confidence, making them popular in fashion and portrait photography. They can add a sense of strength and authority to an image. 3. Diagonal lines: These give a sense of movement and change, emphasising distance from foreground to background. They can create dynamism and energy in a photograph. 4. Curved lines: Whether it's bending flower stalks or rolling hills, curved lines can create compelling compositions by guiding the eye through the entire image. They often add a sense of grace and fluidity to a photograph.By carefully selecting the type of leading lines, photographers can create a specific atmosphere in their images .

Be mindful of lines through the head: In portrait photography, avoid background elements that create lines originating from or running through the subject's head. 2. Balance with other elements: Ensure that leading lines enhance the overall composition without overpowering the subject. Consider the rule of thirds and include a strong focal point. 3. Be aware of framing: Look at the entire frame before taking the shot, as what's inside the frame is just as important as what's outside it. 4. Adjust positioning: If a line is distracting, try moving slightly to the side to reposition it in a more natural or pleasing way. 5. Consider the viewer's perspective: Be conscious of how lines might affect the viewer's perception of the subject. For example, in portrait photography, shooting at eye level can prevent unintentional weakening of the subject's appearance.By mastering these techniques and being mindful of potential distractions, photographers can use leading lines to create visually captivating images that guide the viewer's eye and enhance the overall impact of their photographs.ADVANCED APPLICATIONS OF LEADING LINESTELLING A STORY WITH LEADING LINESLeading lines are a powerful tool for storytelling in photography. They can guide the viewer's eye through a composition, creating a visual narrative: 1. Guiding attention: By carefully positioning leading lines in the frame, photographers can draw attention to specific areas of a photo, such as a beautiful mountain or sunset on the ocean. 2. Creating flow: Leading lines naturally take the viewer on a journey around the photo, keeping them engaged and enhancing the storytelling aspect of the image. 3. Emphasising depth: Leading lines are an excellent way to create three-dimensionality in an image. By emphasising the start of a line before letting it fall away into the backdrop, photographers can create a 3D illusion that looks incredible in scenic landscape photography. 4. Converging lines: When two or more lines converge towards the subject, they create a powerful visual effect that directs the viewer's attention precisely where the photographer intends.WANT STRONGER LEADING-LINE COMPOSITIONS?Fix flat compositions fast.

Unconventional placement: Instead of always placing the subject at the end of leading lines, try positioning it at unexpected points along the line for a more intriguing composition. 2. Multiple leading lines: Experiment with using several leading lines that guide the eye to different parts of the image, creating a more complex and engaging composition. 3. Intersecting lines: Skillfully applied intersecting lines can frame things deliberately in interesting ways, ramping up tension in a shot or adding an element of confusion when desired. 4. Playing with perspective: Try taking the same shot from different heights, experimenting with how the leading lines affect the composition at different positions. 5. Light and shadow: Use light to create interesting shadows that can serve as leading lines, adding depth and intrigue to the image.Remember, while compositional techniques like leading lines can be helpful, they should not be seen as inflexible rules. Photography is a creative endeavour, and the most compelling images often come from pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box. As photographer Bruce Barnbaum suggests, it's important to approach these techniques as ideas or concepts rather than strict rules, allowing for greater creative freedom and expression in your photography.Leading Lines Checklist * Do the lines point to the subject (not out of frame)? * Low viewpoint or wider lens to exaggerate perspective? * Clean edges—no bright lines touching the frame border? * Secondary lines supporting, not competing?Download the 1-Page Field Checklist PDF for Leading LinesCONCLUSIONLeading lines in photography have a profound influence on the viewer's experience, guiding their gaze and shaping the narrative of an image.

These versatile accessories significantly influence various aspects of image capture, from exposure control to colour manipulation. As photographers strive to capture stunning visuals, understanding the role of camera filters becomes essential to elevating their craft and achieving professional-level results.This article delves into camera lens filters, exploring their types, effects, and applications. It examines how different filters like nd filters and variable nd filters can impact long exposure techniques, reduce vignetting, and improve overall image quality. Readers will gain insights into selecting the right filters for their needs, whether they're working with UV filters, circular polarisers, or other specialised options like nd filter sets from brands like Kase or Lee. By the end, photographers will be equipped with the knowledge to harness the full potential of filters in their long -exposure ND filter photography, opening up new avenues for artistic expression and technical mastery.TYPES OF CAMERA LENS FILTERSUV FILTERSInitially designed to reduce ultraviolet light in film photography, UV filters have found a new purpose in the digital age. These clear in their long -exposure ND filter photography, opening up new avenues for artistic expression and technical mastery.TYPES OF CAMERA LENS FILTERSUV FILTERSInitially designed to reduce ultraviolet light in film photography, UV filters have found a new purpose in the digital age. These clear glass filters now serve as a protective shield for camera lenses if you believe in this insurance marketing. They guard against dust, moisture, and accidental scratches, making them essential for outdoor photography. UV filters are handy in harsh environments such as beaches or high-altitude locations where intense sunlight and atmospheric haze can affect image clarity. My own stance on UV filters is never to use them, and I explain in detail the pros and cons of UV Filters in this article .POLARISING FILTERSPolarising filters are indispensable tools for landscape and outdoor photography. They function by blocking polarised light from specific directions, resulting in enhanced colour saturation and contrast. These filters are particularly effective in: 1. Deepening blue skies and making clouds stand out 2. Reducing glare and reflections on non-metallic surfaces like water, glass, or foliage 3. Eliminating shine on leaves, making the water appear transparentPhotographers can rotate the filter while observing changes through the viewfinder to achieve the desired effect. However, it's worth noting that polarising filters work best when shooting at a 90-degree angle to the sun and may not be suitable for wide-angle lenses due to uneven light distribution.Polarising filter to remove reflective glare and light on wet and reflective surfacesNeutral Density FiltersNd filters are designed to reduce the amount of light entering the lens without affecting colour. They allow photographers to: 1. Use slower shutter speeds without overexposing images 2. Create long-exposure effects like silky smooth waterfalls or streaking clouds 3. Shoot with wider apertures in bright conditions for shallow depth of fieldNd filters come in various strengths, measured in stops , allowing photographers to control the amount of light control. They're particularly useful for achieving creative effects in bright lighting conditions. Popular options include nd4 filters, nd8 filters, and variable nd filters like the Lee and Kase filters.ND filters to extend the exposure time to change the rendering of motion in an imageGRADUATED NEUTRAL DENSITY FILTERSGraduated neutral density filters (GND filters) feature a gradient that transitions from dark to clear. They're commonly used in landscape photography to balance exposure between bright skies and darker foregrounds. GND filters come in three main types: 1. Soft-edged: Gradual transition between dark and clear areas 2. Hard-edged: Sharp transition between dark and clear areas 3. Reverse filter: Darkest in the middle, gradually becoming clearer towards the edgesThese graduated ND filters help photographers capture scenes with extreme exposure variations, resulting in well-balanced images without the need for extensive post-processing. Brands like Nisi and Lee offer high-quality GND filters for neutral-density filter photography.Graduated ND Filters to reduce the brightest areas in the imageHOW LENS FILTERS AFFECT YOUR PHOTOSCamera lens filters have a significant influence on image qua he need for extensive post-processing. Brands like Nisi and Lee offer high-quality GND filters for neutral-density filter photography.Graduated ND Filters to reduce the brightest areas in the imageHOW LENS FILTERS AFFECT YOUR PHOTOSCamera lens filters have a significant influence on image quality and creative possibilities in photography. These versatile accessories can dramatically enhance various aspects of image capture, from exposure control to colour manipulation, but low-cost filters can have the opposite effect of reducing image quality and colour accuracy.REDUCING REFLECTIONSOne of the primary reasons photographers use polarising filters is to reduce reflections in a scene. Reflections are ubiquitous in nature, from water surfaces to glass windows and even vegetation. Photographers can significantly cut down on these reflections by using a polarising filter, adding contrast and saturation to the image. This effect is particularly noticeable when photographing waterfalls, where the filter can eliminate reflections from wet rocks and foliage, resulting in a more vibrant and detailed image.ENHANCING COLOURSPolarising filters have the remarkable ability to increase colour saturation in images. By reducing reflections from non-metallic surfaces such as water, glass, and leaves, these filters allow more of the subject's diffuse light to reach the camera sensor. This results in a more colourful representation of the scene. The effect is particularly striking when photographing landscapes, where polarisers can deepen blue skies, make clouds stand out, and enhance the overall vibrancy of the image.CONTROLLING LIGHTND filters are essential for controlling the amount of light entering the camera lens. These filters allow photographers to use slower shutter speeds or wider apertures in bright conditions, opening up creative possibilities for long-exposure photography. ND filters come in various strengths, measured in stops, enabling photographers to achieve effects such as silky smooth waterfalls, streaking clouds, or a shallow depth of field in bright sunlight.CREATING SPECIAL EFFECTSLens filters offer a range of creative possibilities for photographers looking to add unique effects to their images. For instance, by using fishing string or reflective materials in front of the lens, photographers can create anamorphic-style lens flares or interesting reflective blurs. Soft, dreamy effects can be achieved by stretching sheer fabric over the lens, while smearing lip balm around the edges of a filter can produce artistic blurred edges in the image.CHOOSING THE RIGHT LENS FILTERFilter attachment alternatives - 1. Screw on 2. Adapter Holder System 3. Magnetic attachmentFILTER SIZE AND COMPATIBILITYSelecting the appropriate filter size is crucial for compatibility with camera lenses. To determine the correct size, photographers should check the diameter of the lens front, typically marked with a symbol (ø) followed by a number in millimetres. This number indicates the filter thread size. Popular sizes include 72mm and 77mm.It's important to note that different lenses may have varying filter thread sizes. For instance, a lens might require a 67mm filter, while another could need a 77mm filter. To ensure compatibility, photographers should check each lens individually, as sizes can differ based on focal length or lens version.Once the filter thread size is known, finding compatible filters becomes straightfo nce, a lens might require a 67mm filter, while another could need a 77mm filter. To ensure compatibility, photographers should check each lens individually, as sizes can differ based on focal length or lens version.Once the filter thread size is known, finding compatible filters becomes straightforward. However, if multiple lenses with different thread sizes are used, separate filters for each size may be necessary. Brands like Lee and Kase offer a wide range of best filters sets in various sizes with adapter rings to step up or down to the filter sizes you own.Filter QualityThe quality of a filter has a significant impact on image quality. High-quality filters minimally affect image quality, while cheaper options can lead to noticeable degradation. When choosing filters, it's advisable to opt for reputable brands known for producing durable, high-quality options, such as B+W, Hoya, Lee Filters, and Kase.Filter quality is particularly important when considering factors like glass thickness, coatings, and construction materials. Premium filters often use optically purer and thinner glass, which interferes less with the lens's front element. Additionally, the quality of retaining rings should be considered, with brass construction generally preferred over aluminium, which can dent and jam more easily.Stacking FiltersStacking filters can offer creative possibilities but also presents challenges. While it allows for combining effects, such as using ND filters and circular polariser (CPL) filters together, it can potentially decrease image quality. Each additional filter introduces another piece of glass that light must pass through before reaching the sensor. As I always say “ start naked and dress the lens only and when required”Photographers should be aware of potential issues such as vignetting when stacking filters, especially with wide-angle lenses. Additionally, stacking can sometimes introduce unwanted artefacts like glare or reflections and may reduce overall image sharpness.Despite these challenges, stacking can be beneficial in certain situations. For instance, combining ND filters and CPL filters can allow for longer exposures while reducing glare and enhancing colour saturation. However, it's crucial to balance the desired effects with potential image quality trade-offs when deciding to stack filters.----------------------------------------RECOMMENDED CAMERA FILTER SETSLEE FILTERSLee Filters, renowned for their high-quality camera filters, are a staple for photographers seeking to enhance their imagery.

Readers will learn about cloud storage solutions, including popular services like iCloud, OneDrive, and Dropbox, as well as external drive backup options for those who prefer local storage. Additionally, the article delves into alternative backup strategies, such as the 3-2-1 method and using NAS devices, to provide a comprehensive guide for protecting digital photo collections.RISKS OF DATA LOSS The threat of losing years' worth of photographs is a photographer's nightmare. Unfortunately, data loss is an ever-present risk. Hard drives fail unexpectedly, devices malfunction and accidents happen. Even new computers are not immune to hard drive failures, which are inevitable over time. Natural disasters, theft, or accidental deletion can also lead to the permanent loss of irreplaceable images. Without proper backups, all images stored on vulnerable devices are at risk.EMOTIONAL VALUE OF PHOTOGRAPHSPhotographs are timeless artefacts that capture moments frozen in time. They allow people to reminisce and share memories with future generations. Whether it's a family holiday, a wedding, or a significant milestone, images hold immense sentimental value. Losin isk.EMOTIONAL VALUE OF PHOTOGRAPHSPhotographs are timeless artefacts that capture moments frozen in time. They allow people to reminisce and share memories with future generations. Whether it's a family holiday, a wedding, or a significant milestone, images hold immense sentimental value. Losing these cherished images can be distressing, especially when they represent personal memories that cannot be recreated.PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERSFor professional photographers, the stakes are even higher. Losing client images can be devastating and potentially cripple a photography business. All the time spent shooting, culling, and editing images goes to waste if proper backups are not in place. A robust backup strategy is essential to protect not only the photographs but also the photographer's reputation and livelihood.Implementing a comprehensive backup plan ensures that irreplaceable raw files and hard work remain intact. By employing proper categorisation and labelling, photographers can easily locate specific images when needed. Additionally, cloud storage and online backup solutions provide convenient access to images from any device with an internet connection, offering flexibility and peace of mind.HOW TO BACK UP PHOTOSIn today’s digital world, protecting your cherished memories and professional work has never been more important. Whether you’re a casual photographer or a professional, a robust backup strategy ensures that your photos are safe from loss due to device failure, accidental deletion, or other unforeseen disasters. One of the most effective strategies for safeguarding your images is the 3-2-1 backup method.This guide explains the 3-2-1 approach and explores practical solutions for backing up your photos, covering cloud storage, external drives, and other essential strategies for comprehensive data security and the knowledge that your photos are protected.WHY THE 3-2-1 BACKUP METHOD?The 3-2-1 backup method is a trusted strategy in data protection. It requires you to: 1. Keep 3 copies of your data (one primary and two backups). 2. Store these on 2 different types of media (e.g., hard drive and cloud storage). 3. Ensure 1 copy is stored offsite, away from your primary location.This ensures redundancy, resilience, and quick recovery in case of localised data loss.RISKS OF NOT BACKING UP PHOTOSWhether personal or professional, losing photos can be devastating. Devices can fail, be stolen, or damaged, leading to irreversible data loss. While many people share their photos online, relying solely on social media or devices for storage is risky. A proper backup strategy is essential for safeguarding your irreplaceable memories.----------------------------------------CLOUD STORAGE FOR PHOTO BACKUPSCloud storage offers a convenient and secure way to back up your photos offsite. Here’s a comparison of popular cloud storage services, including Amazon Prime, which offers unlimited photo storage for its members:Cloud Storage ProviderFree StoragePaid PlansRecommended ForAmazon PrimeUnlimited photosIncluded with Amazon Prime (£8.99/month or £95/year)Amazon Prime Unlimited Photo Storage for unlimited RAW file supportGoogle Drive15GB100GB for £1.56/monthGeneral users, Google Photos integrationMicrosoft OneDrive5GB100GB for £1.56/month, 1TB for £5.49 lansRecommended ForAmazon PrimeUnlimited photosIncluded with Amazon Prime (£8.99/month or £95/year)Amazon Prime Unlimited Photo Storage for unlimited RAW file supportGoogle Drive15GB100GB for £1.56/monthGeneral users, Google Photos integrationMicrosoft OneDrive5GB100GB for £1.56/month, 1TB for £5.49/monthOneDrive for Microsoft 365 usersiCloud5GB50GB for £0.79/month, 200GB for £2.49/monthiCloud for Apple ecosystem usersDropbox2GB2TB for £7.99/monthDropbox for high storage needs and general backupEXTERNAL DRIVES FOR LOCAL STORAGEBacking up your photos to an external hard drive is another effective method. This provides local control over your data and can be more affordable than cloud storage for large collections.CHOOSING THE RIGHT DRIVE * Solid-State Drives (SSDs) are fast and reliable, ideal for working files. Explore SSD options. * Hard Disc Drives (HDDs) offer larger capacities at lower prices, making them ideal for archiving. Browse HDD options. Ensure you use modern connections like USB 3.0 or Thunderbolt to speed up data transfers when dealing with large image files.BACKUP SOFTWARESoftware like GoodSync, EaseUS Todo Backup, or Macrium Reflect can automate your backups, ensuring regular updates without manual intervention: * GoodSync is highly reliable for synchronising and backing up photos. * EaseUS Todo Backup provides flexible backup solutions. * Macrium Reflect offers comprehensive data backup options.----------------------------------------MY PERSONAL PHOTO BACKUP STRATEGYAs a professional, maintaining a reliable backup system is vital to safeguarding my photo collection and workflow. After experimenting with various methods, I have developed a backup strategy that works best for my needs, blending elements of the 3-2-1 backup method with additional layers of protection for extra security.1. MAIN WORKING DRIVE: NAS WITH RAID 5 (PRIMARY COPY)Once I return from a photoshoot, I immediately transfer my images to my main NAS (Network Attached Storage) drive. The advantage of using a NAS drive is its built-in RAID 5 configuration, which provides both speed and redundancy. This setup spreads the data across multiple drives, ensuring that even if one drive fails, my data remains safe and accessible. It offers a balance between storage capacity, data protection, and performance, making it ideal for securely managing large collections of RAW image files.By using NAS with RAID 5, I not only achieve redundancy, but I also benefit from easy access to my photos from any device on my network. Explore NAS options here 2. LOCAL AND OFFSITE BACKUP WITH EXTERNAL DRIVES (SECONDARY COPY ON DIFFERENT MEDIA)For local and offsite backups, I use a 6TB portable USB drive to create an additional layer of protection. Using GoodSync, I automatically synchronise all my RAW files from my NAS to this external drive. The portable USB drive is stored off-site but close to my house, allowing me quick access if I need to update the backup or restore any data. This ensures that I always hav dditional layer of protection. Using GoodSync, I automatically synchronise all my RAW files from my NAS to this external drive. The portable USB drive is stored off-site but close to my house, allowing me quick access if I need to update the backup or restore any data. This ensures that I always have a convenient, local and offsite backup available without relying solely on cloud services. * 6TB External USB Drives * GoodSync 3. OFFSITE BACKUP WITH AMAZON PRIME (OFFSITE COPY)For my offsite backup, I use Amazon Prime's Unlimited Photo Storage , which automatically synchronises my files to Amazon's S3 servers. This process runs constantly in the background, ensuring that any new photos added, deleted, or edited are updated immediately. I have two separate backups running at all times: 1. All RAW files from my NAS are backed up to Amazon S3, keeping a secure copy of every original image. 2. All edited images (JPEGs and TIFFs) are also backed up, ensuring that both the original and edited versions of my photos are securely stored.This setup gives me peace of mind, knowing that both my unedited RAW files and fully edited images are protected and can be retrieved from anywhere at any time.----------------------------------------BEST BACKUP OPTIONS FOR WINDOWS AND MAC (WITH COSTS)When setting up your 3-2-1 backup strategy, the tools you choose can vary depending on your operating system and budget. Below is a table of the most popular and effective solutions for primary copies, local backups, and cloud backups for both Windows and Mac users, including estimated costs.Backup StageWindows OptionsCost (Estimated)Mac OptionsCost (Estimated)Primary Copy- Internal SSD/HDD: Samsung 870 EVO SSD- Samsung 870 EVO SSD: £60 (500GB),£100 (1TB)- Internal SSD/HDD: Apple SSD - Apple SSD: £200+ (built-in)- NAS: Synology NAS, Drobo NAS- Synology NAS: £350–£600- NAS: Synology NAS, Drobo NAS- Synology NAS: £350–£600Local Backup- External HDD: WD My Passport 6TB- WD My Passport 6TB: £120- External HDD: G-Technology G-Drive 6TB- G-Drive 6TB: £150- Backup Software: GoodSync - GoodSync: Free for personal use, £23.95/year- Backup Software: GoodSync - GoodSync: Free for personal use, £23.95/yearCloud Backup- Cloud Service: Backblaze , Amazon Prime Unlimited Photos- Backblaze: £5/month- Cloud Service: iCloud , Amazon Prime Unlimited Photos- iCloud: £0.79–£2.49/month- Cloud Backup Software: EaseUS Todo Backup- Amazon Prime: £8.99/month or £95/year- Cloud Backup Software: Backblaze - Amazon Prime: £8.99/month or £95/year- EaseUS: Free basic version, £25/year- Backblaze: £5/monthCONCLUSION: SECURE YOUR MEMORIES FOR THE FUTUREBacking up your photos doesn’t have to be complicated.

What is the 3-2-1 backup rule for photos?The 3-2-1 backup rule is a well-established strategy for protecting your data. It involves keeping 3 copies of your data, storing these on 2 different types of media, and ensuring 1 copy is stored offsite. This method minimises the risk of data loss from hardware failure, theft, or natural disasters.2. Can I rely solely on cloud storage for backing up my photos?While cloud storage is a great option for offsite backups, it's advisable not to rely on just one method. Using the 3-2-1 rule, you should combine cloud storage with a local backup, such as an external hard drive. This ensures redundancy in case the cloud service experiences issues or if you lose internet access.3. What’s the best cloud storage service for photos?Amazon Prime offers unlimited photo storage, making it an excellent option for photographers, especially those working with RAW files. Other good choices include Google Drive and iCloud, though these come with storage limits depending on your subscription plan.4. How often should I back up my photos?It’s recommended to back up your photos as soon as possible after adding new images to your collection. If you’re a professional or hobbyist photographer, creating an automatic or scheduled backup routine using tools like GoodSync can ensure your data is always up to date.5. What’s the difference between synchronisation and a backup?Synchronisation ensures files across different devices are always up to date, meaning changes on one device are reflected on others. However, it may not provide full protection, as deletions or errors may sync across devices. A backup, on the other hand, creates a separate copy of your data, protecting it from loss even if the original is deleted or corrupted.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------photography-tips , online photography course Alan Ranger 1 January 2025Alan Ranger Photography tips , bonus module LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

Manual (M) stops the guesswork: you decide the look (depth of field and motion), then set exposure deliberately so a whole series matches—landscapes, long exposures, panoramas, studio/flash, interiors and night work. * Problem: Inconsistent exposures & unexpected changes when the scene or framing alters. * How this post solves it: A clear, repeatable setup for M mode using the meter, histogram and a simple decision order so you control aperture, shutter and ISO with confidence.3 key takeaways 1. Start with intent: pick aperture for depth or shutter for motion, then set a sensible base ISO. 2. Match the meter, then place exposure: dial the remaining setting until the meter is right for your subject; confirm with histogram/blinkies and adjust to protect highlights. 3. Stay consistent: lock the look for a whole sequence; only change one variable at a time to manage light or creative effect.Table of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS MANUAL EXPOSURE IN PHOTOGRAPHYDiving into the intricate world of photography, the mastery of manual camera settings stands as a fundamental cornerstone, empowering photographers with the creative control necessary to realise their vision ----------------------------------INTRODUCTION - WHAT IS MANUAL EXPOSURE IN PHOTOGRAPHYDiving into the intricate world of photography, the mastery of manual camera settings stands as a fundamental cornerstone, empowering photographers with the creative control necessary to realise their vision. By understanding and manipulating these settings, artists can transcend the limitations of automatic modes, achieving precise exposure levels, and crafting images that truly resonate with their intent. This guide illuminates the path for beginners, laying the foundation for an enriching journey into the art and science of photography. With a setting on manual mode, it delves into the essentials of the exposure triangle, metering system, and the nuanced balance between long exposure, overexposure, and underexposure, enabling photographers to capture scenes with unparalleled clarity and creativity.As we journey through this guide, readers will be equipped with a camera manual settings cheat sheet, a valuable tool for those venturing into manual mode for the first time or seeking to refine their understanding of manual camera settings. From the theoretical concepts of the exposure triangle to practical steps for leveraging the metering system for optimal results, this article covers the key settings and techniques instrumental in mastering manual exposure. Furthermore, it will explore the significant advantages and potential drawbacks of manual exposure, offering readers a comprehensive understanding of when and how to apply these techniques to enhance their photographic practice. Empowering photographers with knowledge and skills, this guide aspires to transform enthusiasts into adept visual storytellers, proficient in the art of creative control through the effective use of manual camera settings.OVERVIEW OF MANUAL EXPOSURE IN PHOTOGRAPHYPhotographing in manual mode introduces a level of flexibility and creative control that automatic settings simply cannot offer. When a photographer opts for manual exposure, they assume full responsibility for adjusting the three pivotal elements of the exposure triangle: shutter speed , aperture , and ISO . These settings collectively influence the brightness, sharpness, depth of field, and overall quality of the photograph, determining the meaning of exposure in photography.COMPLETE CONTROL OF CAMERA SETTINGSIn manual mode, every camera setting is at the photographer's discretion, allowing for precise adjustments to each component. This control is particularly beneficial in challenging lighting conditions or when aiming for specific artistic effects like high-key photography or low-key photography. For instance, by modifying the aperture, photographers can alter the depth of field. A wide aperture (e.g., F/1.8) will produce a shallow depth of field, emphasising the subject while blurring the background—ideal for portraits. Conversely, a narrow aperture (e.g., F/16) increases the depth of field, ensuring that everything in the frame, from foreground to background, remains in sharp focus, which is preferred for landscape photography.Shutter speed adjustment is another advantage of manual mode. Fast shutter speeds (e.g., 1/1000th of a second) can freeze fast-moving subjects like wildlife or athletes in motion, ing in the frame, from foreground to background, remains in sharp focus, which is preferred for landscape photography.Shutter speed adjustment is another advantage of manual mode. Fast shutter speeds (e.g., 1/1000th of a second) can freeze fast-moving subjects like wildlife or athletes in motion, capturing every detail with clarity. On the other hand, slower shutter speeds (e.g., 1/30th of a second) can introduce motion blur, adding a sense of movement to subjects like flowing water or speeding vehicles. This is what exposure in photography is all about.ISO control further enhances the photographer's ability to shoot in varied lighting conditions. A higher ISO enables shooting in low light without sacrificing the shutter speed or aperture settings. However, it's crucial to manage ISO carefully as higher values can introduce noise, affecting image quality.Manual mode is not just about technical control but also about artistic freedom. It allows photographers to experiment with different combinations of settings to achieve the desired visual effect, making each captured image a unique expression of their creative vision. This is the essence of exposure photography.OVERVIEW OF MANUAL EXPOSURE (M) — QUICK REFERENCEIn Manual (M) you set aperture, shutter speed and ISO yourself. The scene light stays the same; you choose the rate and time of collection and the amount of amplification (ISO) to match your creative intent.Control What it controls (in M) Typical starting points Creative use Watch-outs Quick tip Aperture (f-number) Opening size → depth of field and light collection rate. Portraits: f/1.8–f/2.8 · Street: f/5.6–f/8 · Landscapes: f/8–f/11 Isolate subject (small f-no.), or maximise front-to-back sharpness (large f-no.). Very small apertures (f/16–f/22) can soften detail (diffraction). Choose aperture for intent first, then set shutter/ISO to match the meter. Shutter speed Collection time → motion freeze or blur. People: 1/250–1/500 s · Sport: 1/1000–1/2000 s · Water/Trails: 1/4–30 s (tripod) Freeze action or blur for creative effect (panning, silky water, light trails). Too slow hand-held → camera shake; too slow for subjects → motion blur. Guardrail: ≈ 1/(2× focal length) hand-held; use support or raise ISO if slower. ISO Signal amplification → exposure flexibility vs noise. Base ISO for maximum quality; raise only as needed to hold aperture/shutter. Maintain safe shutter in low light without sacrificing chosen aperture. Higher ISO increases noise and reduces highlight headroom. Use the lowest ISO that still gives your target shutter and aperture. Meter & histogram Placement of tones, highlight protection, consistency across a series. Zero the meter, then bias slightly to protect highlights (“blinkies” off). High-key/low-key looks by deliberate meter offset in M. LCD brightness misleads; trust histogram and clipping warnings. Lock your look: change only one variable at a time to keep consistency.⚙️ Workflow in M: 1) Set aperture for depth 2) Choose shutter for motion 3) Raise/lower ISO to meet the meter 4) Check histogram & protect highlights.KEY SETTINGS IN MANUAL EXPOSUREISO SENSITIVITYISO sensitivity is a critical setting that adjusts the camera's light sensitivity, directly influencing image brightness. The base ISO, typically around 100, offers the highest image quality with minimal noise. Photographers increase the ISO number to brighten photos (by speeding up exposure time) in darker environments, balanc setting that adjusts the camera's light sensitivity, directly influencing image brightness. The base ISO, typically around 100, offers the highest image quality with minimal noise. Photographers increase the ISO number to brighten photos (by speeding up exposure time) in darker environments, balancing the need for light with the potential increase in noise, which can degrade image quality. High ISO settings are essential in low light conditions but should be used judiciously to avoid excessive graininess in the photos. Understanding what ISO is in photography is crucial for achieving proper exposure.APERTURE AND DEPTH OF FIELDAperture controls the size of the lens' diaphragm, affecting the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor and the depth of field in the images. Measured in f-stops, a lower f-stop number (e.g., f/1.8) means a wider aperture, allowing more light and creating a shallow depth of field. This effect is ideal for portraits where the subject is in sharp focus against a blurred background. Conversely, a higher f-stop number (e.g., f/16) results in a narrower aperture, less light, and a deeper depth of field, suitable for landscape photography or where clarity throughout the entire scene is desired. Aperture is a key component of exposure definition in photography.SHUTTER SPEED AND MOTIONShutter speed determines how long the camera's shutter is open to expose light to the sensor. Fast shutter speeds (e.g., 1/1000th of a second) freeze motion, perfect for capturing fast-moving subjects with clarity. Slow shutter speeds (e.g., 1/2 second), on the other hand, allow more light and can create artistic blur effects in moving subjects, such as waterfalls or bustling city scenes. The choice of shutter speed has a profound impact on both the exposure and artistic expression in photography, making it a pivotal tool in the photographer's toolkit. Shutter speed is essential to the exposure meaning in photography.----------------------------------------STEPS TO USE MANUAL MODE EFFICIENTLYQUICK TIPS — MANUAL MODE (M) IN 3 STEPS 1. Set Aperture for Depth Single subject/couple close: f/1.8–f/2.8 for separation. Subjects slightly apart: f/2.8–f/4 to hold both sharp. Larger groups: start at f/2.8–f/4+ and adjust with spacing. Landscapes/architecture: typically f/8–f/11. 2. Choose Shutter for Motion Static scenes: about 1/60 s (watch for shake). Slow movement (walk/dance): ~1/200 s. Faster action (quick dance/jog): ≥ 1/500 s to freeze. Hand-held guardrail: ~1/(2× focal length); use support/IBIS if slower. 3. Set ISO to Meet the Meter Use the lowest ISO that keeps your chosen aperture/shutter. Too dark → raise ISO; too bright → lower ISO to hit the meter. Prefer speed? Enable Auto ISO with a minimum shutter so the camera adjusts ISO while you lock aperture & shutter intent. * Confirm exposure: check histogram/blinkies; bias to protect highlights if needed. * One change at a time: keep consistency across a series; adjust only A, S, or ISO per decision.SETTING APERTURE FIRSTWhen using manual mode efficiently, the first step is to determine the appropriate aperture based on the subject and desired depth of field. For instance, capturing a solo portrait or a couple close together often requires an aperture around f/1.8 or f/2 to focus sharply on the subjects whi E FIRSTWhen using manual mode efficiently, the first step is to determine the appropriate aperture based on the subject and desired depth of field. For instance, capturing a solo portrait or a couple close together often requires an aperture around f/1.8 or f/2 to focus sharply on the subjects while blurring the background. If the subjects are slightly apart, an aperture of f/2.8 or even f/4 ensures everyone remains in focus. For larger groups, start at f/2.8 and adjust upwards to f/4 or higher, depending on the group's size and arrangement. This is a key aspect of what exposure is in photography.ADJUSTING SHUTTER SPEED NEXTOnce the aperture is set, the next focus is on shutter speed, which should align with the subject's movement. For static subjects or stationary objects, a shutter speed of 1/60th of a second may suffice. However, for subjects in motion, such as walking or dancing slowly, shutter speeds around 1/200th of a second are ideal. For faster movements, like quick dancing or jogging, it's crucial not to drop below 1/500th of a second to capture sharp, freeze-frame images without blur. Shutter speed is a fundamental part of the exposure meaning in photography.FINALISING WITH ISOAfter setting the aperture and shutter speed, the final step is adjusting the ISO to achieve the correct exposure. This adjustment is straightforward: if the image appears too dark, increase the ISO until the desired brightness is achieved; if it's too bright, decrease the ISO. This simple method allows photographers to quickly find the right exposure for their specific shooting scenario, ensuring the image is neither overexposed nor underexposed. ISO is a key factor in determining exposure in photography. Alternatively you can set ISO to Auto and allow the camera meter to calculate the required amount of ISO to expose the image correctly.INTERACTIVE: EXPOSURE CALCULATOROpen full screen or open in a new tab ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF MANUAL EXPOSURE✓ DO — WHEN & HOW TO USE MANUAL * Set intent first: pick aperture for depth or shutter for motion, then match the meter with ISO. * Use M for consistency: stable/controlled light, panoramas, long exposures, flash/studio, HDR/backlight. * Verify exposure: histogram + blinkies/zebras; protect highlights and change one variable at a time.✗ DON’T — COMMON PITFALLS * Don’t chase the meter every reframe—lock your look; otherwise exposures drift shot-to-shot. * Don’t let shutter slip below a safe limit hand-held—open aperture or raise ISO instead. * Don’t force M in chaos: for rapidly changing action, use Av/Tv with exposure comp or Auto ISO min shutter.Manual exposure in photography provides photographers with unparalleled control over the final image, allowing them to manipulate settings such as ISO, aperture, and shutter speed to achieve their desired artistic effects. This control is particularly beneficial in challenging lighting conditions or when aiming for a specific aesthetic. However, mastering manual exposure requires a deep understanding of photography principles and can be more time-consuming than using semi-automatic modes.PROS AND CONSOne of the main advantages of manual exposure i",

      "articleBody": "TRIPOD FOR CAMERA: GUIDE TO WHICH, WHY, HOW TO USE A TRIPODTable of Contents Show----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION - TRIPOD FOR CAMERAInvesting in a high-quality camera tripod is necessary for any photographer aspiring to consistently capture breathtaking landscape photography images. This unassuming three-legged accessory might seem simple, but its impact on your photographic prowess is profound. The best tripod for camera eliminates the risk of camera shake by providing an unwavering, stable platform, ensuring tack-sharp focus and impeccable image quality, regardless of the lighting environment.However, the benefits of a tripod extend far beyond mere technical perfection. This versatile companion empowers you to slow down, meticulously observe your surroundings, and thoughtfully compose each frame. With the ability to make minute adjustments to panning, tilting, and height, you can achieve tighter compositions, ultimately crafting the perfect shot that encapsulates your creative vision.THE ART OF STEADY SHOOTING: MASTERING LONG EXPOSURESOne of the most compelling reasons to embrace tripod use is the opportunity to explore the enchanting realm of long exposure photography. By lengthening the shutter speed, you can create mesmerising effects that transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary works of art. Think of silky-smooth waterfalls, ethereal light trails, or star trails that dance across the night sky – all of these captivating te alm of long exposure photography. By lengthening the shutter speed, you can create mesmerising effects that transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary works of art. Think of silky-smooth waterfalls, ethereal light trails, or star trails that dance across the night sky – all of these captivating techniques demand the unwavering stability that only a best tripod for landscape photography can provide.DEPTH OF FIELD MASTERY: NO COMPROMISESWhen shooting handheld, achieving maximum depth of field often requires compromising on other essential settings, such as ISO or shutter speed. However, with a best dslr tripod by your side, you can bid farewell to such trade-offs. By combining a small aperture (typically f/8 to f/16) with a low ISO (100 to 400), you can capture images with incredible depth of field, ensuring that every element in your frame is rendered with razor-sharp clarity, from the foreground to the distant horizon.EXPANDING YOUR PHOTOGRAPHIC HORIZONSThe applications of tripod use are virtually limitless, spanning a diverse array of subjects and situations. Night photography, macro shots, and panoramic vistas are just a few examples that demand an unnaturally steady hand due to the extended exposure times required. With a sturdy professional camera tripod optimising the effect, you can confidently explore these creative avenues, expanding your photographic range and pushing the boundaries of your artistic expression.ERGONOMIC BENEFITS: REDUCE FATIGUE, ENHANCE COMFORTAs a landscape photographer, you'll often carry hefty gear while hiking or traversing rugged terrain. In such scenarios, fatigue can become your nemesis, compromising your ability to capture fleeting moments of natural beauty. Counterintuitively, adding a lightweight camera tripod to your kit can actually alleviate this burden. By allowing your camera tripod to bear the weight of your digital camera, you can conserve your energy and avoid the dreaded shaky hands that can ruin an otherwise perfect shot.SETTING UP YOUR TRIPOD: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDEProper tripod use is crucial to ensure optimal performance and longevity. Follow these step-by-step instructions to get started: 1. Extend the Legs: Begin by extending the smallest bottom legs first. This tripod setup technique helps prevent dirt, sand, and grit from being pushed up into the next leg section, preserving the joints. 2. Increase Height Gradually: Extend the bottom legs fully, followed by the next section, and finally the top section. This approach saves you from bending down to make height adjustments. 3. Widen the Stance: Extend the telescoping legs to their widest stopping point at each angle, allowing for maximum stability and wind resistance. Most tripod legs offer two or three additional width positions if needed. 4. Level the Playing Field: Strive to get the tripod stand for camera as level as possible. Use the built-in bubble level on the tripod head or stand perpendicular to the tripod and visually check if the center column appears perfectly vertical. 5. Align with Your Subject: Position one tripod leg at the same angle as your lens, with the lens positioned between the rear two legs. This camera mounting position reduces the risk of the tripod falling forward.TRIPOD USAGE TIPS: MAXIMIZING STABILITY AND PRECISIONOnce your tripod for camera is set up, follow these best practices to ensure optimal performance: * Minimise Center Column Extension: Only use the center colu egs. This camera mounting position reduces the risk of the tripod falling forward.TRIPOD USAGE TIPS: MAXIMIZING STABILITY AND PRECISIONOnce your tripod for camera is set up, follow these best practices to ensure optimal performance: * Minimise Center Column Extension: Only use the center column as a last resort for extra height. Extending it creates a single point of connection, destabilising the weight distribution. * Balance Heavier Lenses: If you're using a hefty zoom lens, mount it on the tripod using its tripod collar. This redistributes and balances the weight of the camera with tripod and lens. Some photographers use an L-Bracket to allow the camera to be rotated rather than flipping the camera to vertical on the tripod head. * Ditch the Camera Strap: Invest in a detachable camera strap system. Flapping straps can introduce vibrations, disrupt your workflow, and even topple the tripod if caught. * Use a Remote Release Cable: Employ a wireless remote or a self-timer to fire the shutter. This eliminates the risk of introducing camera shake when pressing the shutter button. * Disable Image Stabilisation: When your gear is mounted on a stable tripod for camera, turn off image stabilisation to prevent unnecessary compensation for non-existent movement.TRIPOD CARE AND MAINTENANCE: PRESERVING YOUR INVESTMENTProper care and maintenance are essential to ensure your tripod for camera remains a reliable companion for years to come. Follow these simple tips: * Allow for Drying: Always leave an inch of the smallest leg extended, even when storing the tripod. This allows time for dirt and moisture to dry and fall off the feet and bottom leg section. * Gentle Cleaning: Clean the tripod with a damp cloth, avoiding soap or other liquids that could damage the materials. * Brush Away Debris: Use a soft brush or an old toothbrush to remove sand and dirt from the tripod leg joints. * Always Stand Upright: Always stand the tripod for camera on its three fully extended legs when not in use. Laying it down on its side can increase the risk of damage to the leg joints and tripod head. * Proper Storage: Store the tripod for camera standing upright, if possible, or laying down in a soft, padded bag in a dry place. This protects it from knocks and accidents while allowing it to dry completely.CHOOSING THE PERFECT TRIPOD: FACTORS TO CONSIDERWith a plethora of tripod brands available on the market, selecting the right one can be a daunting task. Consider these crucial factors to ensure your tripod for camera meets your specific needs:HEIGHT AND WEIGHTView fullsizeYour Height vs. Tripod Height Needed * Tripod Height: Ideally, choose a tripod that, when fully extended (without using the center column), reaches your chin level. This height allows you to comfortably operate the camera without stooping or straining your back. Use the chart to match your height to the tripod height needed to be able to stand straight and use your camera on the tripod without having to stoop. * Tripod Weight: While lightweight tripods are convenient for travel, they may not provide sufficient stability for heavier camera with tripod combinations. Strike a balance between portability and load-bearing capacity by considering the maximum load weight specified by the manufacturer.BUDGET AND LONGEVITY * Budget: Tripod brands prices can vary significantly, ranging from best budget tripods to high-end, professional-grade models. Determine ons. Strike a balance between portability and load-bearing capacity by considering the maximum load weight specified by the manufacturer.BUDGET AND LONGEVITY * Budget: Tripod brands prices can vary significantly, ranging from best budget tripods to high-end, professional-grade models. Determine your budget while considering the potential longevity and durability of the tripod. * Longevity: Investing in a quality tripod for camera can be a wise decision, as it will likely serve you well for many years, even as your photography skills and equipment evolve.STABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY * Stability: Tripod stability is paramount, especially when shooting in challenging environments like windy conditions or uneven terrain. Look for tripods with sturdy construction, robust leg locks, and vibration-dampening features that showcase tripod toughness. * Flexibility: Consider the range of shots you plan to take and choose a tripod that offers versatility. Features like removable center columns, multi-angle leg positioning, and low-level shooting capabilities can greatly enhance your creative freedom.TRIPOD HEAD OPTIONS * Ball Head: Ball heads offer quick and easy positioning but may lack precision for fine adjustments. They often come with a quick release plate for fast camera attachment and removal. * Pan-Tilt Head: These heads provide separate controls for panning and tilting, allowing for precise framing and composition. * Geared Head: Geared heads are the ultimate choice for meticulous composition, offering smooth, incremental adjustments through knobs or gears. * Gimbal Head: The gimbal head provides damped movement of your telephoto lens and camera about the vertical and horizontal axes—similar in feel to a video fluid head.View fullsizeTripod Head Options----------------------------------------RECOMMENDED LIGHTWEIGHT TRIPODS FOR TRAVEL PHOTOGRAPHYIf portability is a priority, consider these lightweight tripod brands options, ideal for travel photography:BENRO RHINO SERIESThe Benro Rhino Series tripods are a perfect blend of strength and portability.

This unique form of artistic expression challenges photographers to see beyond the literal, focusing on shapes, patterns, and textures to create compelling images. By emphasising visual elements and composition, abstract photography can evoke emotions and spark imagination in ways that traditional photography often cannot.In this article, readers will discover essential techniques to master abstraction photography. They will learn to explore composition creatively, find inspiration in unexpected places, and develop their distinctive style. The guide will also delve into overcoming common challenges in abstract photography, offering practical tips to help photographers push the boundaries of their artistic vision. Whether one is a beginner or an experienced photographer, this comprehensive exploration of abstract art photography aims to inspire and elevate their craft.UNDERSTANDING ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYAbstract photography is a unique form of artistic expression that moves away from literal representation, focusing instead on visual elements such as shapes, patterns, textures, and composition. It challenges photographers to see beyond the obvious, capturing the essence of a subject through unconventional perspectives and techniques.DEFINITION AND CON ion that moves away from literal representation, focusing instead on visual elements such as shapes, patterns, textures, and composition. It challenges photographers to see beyond the obvious, capturing the essence of a subject through unconventional perspectives and techniques.DEFINITION AND CONCEPTAbstract photography is often associated with various avant-garde movements, including the Photo-Secession, Straight Photography, and New Vision. Since the late 19th century, photographers have sought to match the formal and conceptual advances of other genres within Modern Art, resulting in a diverse body of work that departs from traditional photography.IMPORTANCE IN ARTAbstract photography plays a vital role in the world of fine art by offering photographers a means of creative expression, encouraging viewers to engage with abstract photos in new ways, and contributing to ongoing conversations about the nature and possibilities of the medium. It allows abstract photographers to convey emotions, moods, or ideas through visual elements without relying on literal representation, inviting viewers to interpret and engage with the images in their unique ways.DIFFERENCE FROM TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHYUnlike traditional photography, which often aims to capture recognisable objects or scenes, abstract photography focuses on elements such as colour, form, texture, and composition to evoke emotions, ideas, and impressions. It encourages experimentation with unconventional techniques, new perspectives, and more obscure subject matter, pushing the boundaries of the medium and prompting viewers to reconsider their perceptions of the world around them.ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES FOR ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYAbstract photography has the power to transform ordinary subjects into extraordinary visual experiences. By employing various techniques, artists can create captivating images that emphasise shapes, patterns, textures, and composition. Three essential techniques for mastering abstract photography are intentional camera movement, macro and close-up shots, and playing with light and shadow.INTENTIONAL CAMERA MOVEMENT (ICM);involves the deliberate movement of the camera during a single exposure. By panning, swaying, or twirling the camera, photographers can create dynamic and expressive images that blur the lines between reality and abstraction. ICM allows for experimentation and personal expression, resulting in unique and captivating abstract photosMACRO AND CLOSE-UP SHOTS;offer another avenue for abstract art photography. By focusing on the intricate details of a subject, photographers can reveal hidden patterns, textures, and shapes that might otherwise go unnoticed. Macro photography encourages a fresh perspective on everyday objects, inviting viewers to see the world in a new light.PLAYING WITH LIGHT AND SHADOW;is a fundamental aspect of abstract photography.Photographers can create depth, drama, and emphasis in their images by exploiting the relationship between light and shadows . Shadows can enhance tonal contrast, direct attention, create focal points, and evoke specific moods or emotions. Experimenting with different lighting techniques can lead to striking and thought-provoking abstract photographs.EXPLORING COMPOSITION IN ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYComposition plays a crucial role in abstract photography, as it guides the viewer's eye and c ts, and evoke specific moods or emotions. Experimenting with different lighting techniques can lead to striking and thought-provoking abstract photographs.EXPLORING COMPOSITION IN ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYComposition plays a crucial role in abstract photography, as it guides the viewer's eye and creates a sense of balance and harmony within the image. By thoughtfully arranging visual elements, abstract portrait photographers can evoke emotions and convey their artistic vision effectively.THE RULE OF THIRDS;This fundamental compositional technique divides the frame into a 3x3 grid, placing key elements along the lines or at their intersections. However, abstract photography often goes beyond this traditional guideline , encouraging experimentation with unconventional placements and asymmetry to create visual intrigue.NEGATIVE SPACE;the area surrounding the main subject is another powerful tool in abstract composition. By carefully considering the balance between positive and negative space , photographers can emphasise their subject, create a sense of depth, and evoke a specific mood or atmosphere.PATTERNS AND REPETITION;are also essential aspects of abstract composition. Identifying and capturing repeating shapes, lines, or textures can create a mesmerising visual rhythm that draws the viewer into the image. Breaking these patterns strategically can add an element of surprise and further engage the audience.Ultimately, exploring composition in abstract photography is about finding a delicate balance between structure and creativity, allowing the photographer's unique perspective to shine through while creating a visually compelling image that captivates the viewer.FINDING INSPIRATION FOR ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYInspiration for abstract photography can be found in a variety of places, from everyday objects to nature and urban environments. By exploring these sources, photographers can develop their creative vision and capture unique, thought-provoking images.EVERYDAY OBJECTS;offer a wealth of opportunities for abstract photography. Simple items like textured fabrics, weathered surfaces, or food can be transformed into compelling visual elements through close-up shots, exciting angles, and creative lighting. By focusing on the intricate details and patterns within these objects, photographers can create images that challenge the viewer's perception and evoke emotion.NATURE AND LANDSCAPES;provide endless inspiration for abstract photography . From the delicate veins of a leaf to the sweeping lines of a sand dune, the natural world is filled with captivating shapes, textures, and patterns. By isolating these elements and experimenting with composition, photographers can create stunning abstract images highlighting the beauty and complexity of their environment.URBAN ENVIRONMENTS;also present a rich source of inspiration for abstract photography. The geometric shapes of buildings, the interplay of light and shadow on city streets, and the vibrant colour of graffiti and street art all offer opportunities for creative exploration. By capturing the unique character and energy of urban spaces, photographers can create abstract images that tell powerful stories about the world we live in.DEVELOPING YOUR ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHY STYLEDeveloping a unique abstract photography style involves exper nities for creative exploration. By capturing the unique character and energy of urban spaces, photographers can create abstract images that tell powerful stories about the world we live in.DEVELOPING YOUR ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHY STYLEDeveloping a unique abstract photography style involves experimenting with various approaches, creating a cohesive portfolio , and using abstraction to tell compelling stories. Photographers should explore different techniques, such as intentional camera movement, macro photography, and playing with light and shadow, to discover their preferred methods of capturing abstract images.Building a cohesive portfolio is crucial for showcasing your distinctive style. Curate a collection of images that demonstrate your artistic vision and evoke strong emotions in viewers. Consider the colours, textures, and compositions that best represent your personal aesthetic.Abstract photography can be a powerful tool for storytelling. By focusing on visual elements rather than literal representations, photographers can convey complex ideas and emotions. Experiment with layering meaning into your images through careful composition and colour choices to create thought-provoking narratives.OVERCOMING CHALLENGES IN ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYAbstract photography has the power to challenge perceptions and spark creativity, but it also presents unique obstacles. Photographers must learn to find unique perspectives, balance creativity with technical skill, and critically evaluate their own work to create compelling abstract images.One of the primary challenges in abstract photography is finding fresh and engaging perspectives. To overcome this, photographers should train their eyes to look beyond the obvious, seeking out patterns, textures, and shapes that might otherwise go unnoticed. Experimenting with different angles, close-up shots, and unconventional viewpoints can help reveal the extraordinary within the ordinary.Another hurdle is striking a balance between creativity and technique. While abstract photography encourages artistic expression, technical proficiency is still essential. Photographers must master elements such as composition, lighting, and focus to effectively convey their vision. Practising and experimenting with various techniques can help develop the skills needed to translate creative ideas into successful abstract photographs.Finally, critiquing one's own work is crucial for growth and improvement in abstract photography. Photographers should regularly review their images critically, assessing elements like composition, colour, and emotional impact. Seeking feedback from peers or mentors can provide valuable insights and help refine one's approach to abstract photography.By embracing these challenges as opportunities for growth, photographers can push the boundaries of their creativity and produce stunning abstract images that captivate and inspire.CONCLUSIONAbstract photography opens up a world of creative possibilities, encouraging photographers to see beyond the ordinary and capture the essence of their subjects in unique ways. By mastering techniques like intentional camera movement, macro photography, and playing with light and shadow, photographers can create captivating images that impact viewers' emotions and perceptions. Exploring composition, finding inspiration in everyday objects and surroundings, an unique ways. By mastering techniques like intentional camera movement, macro photography, and playing with light and shadow, photographers can create captivating images that impact viewers' emotions and perceptions.

Photographers can produce thought-provoking and visually stunning abstract images by embracing these hurdles and continuously refining their skills. This artistic journey enhances individual creativity and enriches the broader world of photography, inspiring others to see the world through a different lens.----------------------------------------FAQS - ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHYWhat methods can be employed to produce abstract photographs?To capture exceptional abstract images, one effective method is to move your camera during the exposure. This requires using a slower shutter speed than usual. Typically, shutter speeds are around 1/200 seconds, but for capturing motion in abstract photography, you might use speeds as slow as 1/10 of a second or even slower.How can one introduce beginners to abstract photography?Here are some foundational tips for teaching abstract photography to novices: Start by focusing on everyday objects. Utilise design elements to enhance your images. Explore macro photography. Try shooting through various objects. Experiment with capturing motion. Learn the art of subtraction to simplify scenes. Adjust your lighting for different effects, and try out various shooting techniques.What are the key elements of abstract photography?The three primary elements that define abstract photography are form, colour, and texture. Form refers to the shapes within the image, which play a similar role to composition in traditional photography and are considered the central aspect of the image.What is the ideal shutter speed for abstract photography?For abstract and artistic effects, shutter speeds typically range from 1/30 to 1/2 a second, and sometimes even longer. These speeds are just beyond the capacity for hand-held shooting, yet not so long that the subject becomes entirely blurred.----------------------------------------photography-tips , online photography course Alan Ranger 1 January 2025tips , bonus module LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 [",

Among photography experts, there's a split in opinion, with varying advice on how these filters affect image quality. Scientific evidence is scant on the efficacy of Ultraviolet filters in blocking ultraviolet light and reducing blue casts in photographs. So, what is a Ultraviolet filters? It's a lens attachment that not only offers lens protection from dust and scratches but also aims to improve image quality by filtering out ultraviolet light.SO, WHAT IS A ULTRAVIOLET FILTER, AND WHAT IS ITS PURPOSE?It is an ‘Ultra Violet’ filter that screws onto the end of your lens. Its intended purpose is based on two main arguments:1. It protects the end of the lens from scratches and dust.2. It blocks out ultraviolet light and removes a blue cast on images.UV FiltersUV FILTERS FOR CAMERAS: THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO UV PROTECTION LENS FILTER AND IMAGE QUALITYAre Ultraviolet filters necessary accessories or mere marketing gimmicks for your camera lens? This question has sparked a debate among photographers for years. To shed some light on the topic, we will explore the purpose and benefits of a UV filter for cameras. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced photographer, understanding the use of a UV filter can help you make an informed decision about whether to use them on your lenses.Personally, I'm sceptical about the necessity of UV filters and their value as a purchase. Retailers often push these lens filters onto customers investing in a new lens, using a sales approach that suggests they need this camera accessory for uv protection. This sales approach is similar to that used when buying an electronic device and being coaxed into additional spending on warranties or insurance. Let's explore the main arguments for and against using a camera UV filter on your lens.WHAT DO UV FILTERS DO AND HOW DO THEY WORK?UV filters, or ultraviolet filters, are lens attachments primarily designed to block incoming ultraviolet light rays (UV Light) from reaching the camera sensor. In the 's explore the main arguments for and against using a camera UV filter on your lens.WHAT DO UV FILTERS DO AND HOW DO THEY WORK?UV filters, or ultraviolet filters, are lens attachments primarily designed to block incoming ultraviolet light rays (UV Light) from reaching the camera sensor. In the film era, these filters were essential for reducing the effects of ultraviolet haze and radiation on the captured images. However, with the advancement of digital cameras, the role of a camera UV filter has evolved, adapting to the new technology.While modern digital sensors are less sensitive to ultraviolet light, UV filters still offer valuable benefits. They act as a protective layer for your camera lens, shielding it from dust, dirt, scratches, and other potential damage. Additionally, a UV filter can improve image quality by reducing haze and minimizing the blue color cast caused by ultraviolet light in certain conditions.LENS PROTECTION: THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF ULTRAVIOLET FILTERSOne of the main reasons photographers choose to use UV filters is for lens protection. By attaching a UV camera filter to the front of your lens, you create a barrier that guards against dust, dirt, and other contaminants. This is particularly useful when shooting in outdoor environments where the lens is exposed to various elements, providing an essential safeguard with lens filters.Ultraviolet filters are especially beneficial when photographing in challenging conditions such as windy or dusty environments. They help prevent debris from reaching the camera lens surface, ensuring that your images remain clear and free from unwanted artefacts. Moreover, UV filters provide an extra layer of lens protection against accidental drops or impacts, minimising the risk of lens damage.DEBUNKING IMAGE QUALITY CONCERNSThere is a common misconception that Ultraviolet filters can degrade image quality. However, this is not necessarily the case. The key to maintaining optimal image quality while using any filter lies in choosing one of the best filters from a reputable manufacturer, which can make all the difference.Top-notch filters are designed to have minimal impact on image quality. They are crafted with optical glass elements and feature multi-layer coatings that reduce optical aberrations. These professional quality filters preserve clarity, sharpness, and colour accuracy, ensuring that your images retain their true quality.It is worth noting that stacking multiple lens filters, such as a UV filter, on a camera lens can potentially lead to some loss of image quality. The additional layers of glass may introduce slight vignetting or flare. However, these effects can be minimised by using high-quality filters and paying attention to filter compatibility.UV FILTERS IN THE DIGITAL ERA: DO THEY STILL SERVE A PURPOSE?With the advancement of digital cameras, the necessity of UV filters, which protect against ultraviolet light, has been questioned. Built-in sensors in modern digital cameras are equipped to eliminate UV light, reducing the need for a the filter. However, experienced photographers argue that an Ultraviolet filter can still offer advantages in terms of image enhancement and camera lens protection.While digital sensors may filter out most ultraviolet light, there are still situations where a UV can improve the camera lens image quality. For example, when shooting in overcast conditions or areas with low light, a UV filter can help to reduc rms of image enhancement and camera lens protection.While digital sensors may filter out most ultraviolet light, there are still situations where a UV can improve the camera lens image quality.

Yet, when I choose premium UV filters like those from B+W or Tiffen, the effect on image sharpness is barely perceptible. This makes the decision to employ a UV lens filter one of weighing lens protection benefits against a barely-there loss in image clarity. * IMAGES OF FLARES AND GHOSTSLens flare, which is often intensified by the use of budget lens filters, results from light scattering that causes bright light to spread across the filter's glass surfaces. This phenomenon contributes to a rise in ghosting and flare under certain lighting conditions and is typically more pronounced with subpar filters. * DIMINISHED ILLUMINATION While definitive evidence is lacking to conclusively support or debunk the notion, a top-notch UV filter is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the light quality that reaches a camera's sensor. Nonetheless, it's important to recognize that lenses are designed to deliver their best performance without any filters, though accessories like polarizers and density filters can be indispensable for creating specific photographic effects and managing exposures. * DIMINISHED RESOLUTION The influence of a UV filter on resolution is particularly critical when using telephoto lenses, as it is directly linked to the filter's optical quality. Inexpensive UV filters might degrade resolution due to their inferior optical properties. For the sharpest results, it's essential to maintain a clean UV filter since any dirt or smudges will be more visible on the filter than on the lens element. * VIGNETTING WHEN USING WIDER FOCAL LENGTHS When stacking multiple circular filters, such as a UV filter, polarizer, ND filter, or GND filter onto a lens, one might notice vignetting, which manifests as darkened corners within the image frame. This effect of vignetting is more pronounced when these filters are combined and used at wider focal lengths, whi",

Meters assume scenes average to mid-grey. Backlight, stage lights, snow/sand and dark subjects fool it, so exposures drift.This post shows you how to choose the right metering mode (Matrix/Evaluative, Centre-weighted, Spot), place tones deliberately with exposure compensation or Manual, and verify using the histogram and highlight warnings.3 key takeaways 1. Pick the mode for the scene: Matrix for general use; Centre-weighted for balanced portraits; Spot for tricky contrast (meter the subject, not the sky). 2. Place exposure, don’t chase it: Bright scenes (snow/sand) need about +1 to +2 EV; dark scenes often need −1 to −2 EV. In Manual, bias your settings the same way. 3. Confirm with feedback: Use the histogram & blinkies to protect highlights.

What is the meaning o rstanding the fundamentals of light and exposure is essential for every photographer, marking the heart of what makes a great photograph. In the realm of photography, metering is a critical skill that enables photographers to measure the intensity of light in a scene precisely. What is the meaning of metering in photography? It's a technique to determine the correct camera exposure, ensuring photographs are neither too bright nor too dark. By mastering the art of metering, photographers can harness light to enhance their creative expression, making the knowledge of how to use a photographic light meter or a light meter camera indispensable.This guide will navigate through the essential aspects of metering in photography, beginning with an in-depth look at the different camera metering modes such as spot metering, matrix metering, center-weighted metering, partial metering, and highlight-weighted metering. Each mode offers unique advantages depending on the lighting conditions and the subject matter. Following that, we will explore common metering scenarios where understanding light measurement becomes crucial. Advancing further, readers will be introduced to advanced metering techniques that break conventional rules for more creative outcomes. Through this article, beginners will find a comprehensive roadmap to mastering what is light metering in photography, paving the way for them to fully unlock their creative potential whether they are using DSLR or mirrorless cameras.UNDERSTANDING CAMERA METERINGIn photography, metering is the method by which a camera, whether a DSLR or mirrorless camera, assesses the light in a scene to establish the appropriate exposure settings such as shutter speed , aperture , and ISO . This process is crucial as it influences the brightness or darkness of the photo. Modern digital cameras are equipped with an integrated light meter that measures the reflected light hitting the camera sensor, thereby automating the exposure calculation to optimize the photograph's outcome.THE ROLE OF METERING IN EXPOSUREMetering plays a pivotal role in managing exposure. It ensures that the camera correctly interprets the light in a scene based on the assumption that the scene reflects 18% grey of the incident light, which is considered middle grey. This standard helps in maintaining consistent exposure across various lighting conditions and maximising the camera's dynamic range. However, this assumption can lead to under or overexposure if the subject reflects light differently, such as in white-on-white or black-on-black scenes. To counteract these discrepancies, cameras offer exposure compensation, allowing photographers to adjust the exposure to achieve the desired brightness.AUTOMATIC VS MANUAL METERING - WHAT IS METERINGCameras typically provide several metering modes, each suitable for different shooting conditions. The most common modes include: 1. Matrix or Evaluative Metering: This default mode divides the frame into multiple zones, which are analysed for light and colour variance, making it suitable for general photography. 2. Center-weighted Metering: This mode prioritises the center of the frame and is ideal for subjects centrally located, like in portrait photography. 3. Spot Metering: It measures light at a specific point in the frame using light and colour variance, making it suitable for general photography. 2. Center-weighted Metering: This mode prioritises the center of the frame and is ideal for subjects centrally located, like in portrait photography. 3. Spot Metering: It measures light at a specific point in the frame using a spot light meter, offering high precision, which is beneficial for high-contrast scenes or when a small, significant detail needs correct exposure. 4. Highlight-weighted Metering: A newer mode that protects highlights from overexposure, perfect for scenes with bright spots.QUICK TIPS — METERING MADE SIMPLE * Remember the rule: camera meters try to make the scene mid-grey. Bright scenes need +EV; dark scenes often need −EV. * Matrix/Evaluative: general use. Lets the camera average the whole frame. Add +1 to +2 EV for snow/sand; use −⅓ to −⅔ EV to protect bright skies. * Centre-weighted: balances the frame but favours the middle. Great for portraits and static subjects where the background is brighter/darker than the face. * Spot: meters a very small area (subject/face/highlight). Aim it at what must be correctly exposed. For faces in backlight: meter the face and set; for highlight control: meter a bright area and bias −⅓ to −⅔ EV. * Partial: larger than spot (brand dependent). Use when the subject fills a modest portion of the frame but you still want subject-biased metering. * Highlight-weighted: prioritises bright regions. Ideal for stage/theatre or specular scenes to avoid clipping—often no negative comp needed. * Place, don’t chase: choose mode → dial exposure (or comp) for the subject → keep that placement as you reframe. * Verify: check histogram & blinkies/zebras. If highlights clip, reduce exposure by ~⅓–⅔ stop and recheck. * Fast workflow: Av/Tv with exposure comp for changing light; Manual (or M + Auto ISO) for consistency and deliberate tone placement.Choosing the correct metering mode depends on the scene's complexity and the photographer's intent. In semi automatic modes like aperture priority or shutter priority mode, you can select metering mode based on the scene's lighting conditions. Conversely, manual mode allows more direct control, letting photographers override the metering mode based on their specific needs, which is particularly useful in challenging light scenarios or for achieving creative effects.COMPARING METERING MODES - WHAT IS METERINGCOMPARING METERING MODES — WHAT IS METERING?Mode What it reads / area Best for How to use (placement) Typical EV tweak* Matrix / Evaluative Analyses whole frame in zones; averages toward mid-grey. General scenes; walk-around; when subject and background are similar brightness. Compose normally; use exposure compensation to “place” the tones. Bright scenes (snow/sand): +1 to +2 EV. Protect sky: −⅓ to −⅔ EV. Centre-weighted Emphasises central area; downweights corners/edges. Portraits, static subjects near centre; balanced scenes with brighter/darker edges. Place subject near centre; fine-tune with small ±EV. Faces against bright background: +⅓ to +1 EV. Spot Tiny area (≈1–5% of frame) around focus point. High-contrast scenes; small subjects (birds, stage performers). Aim at the subject (skin, mid-tone). For highlight placement, meter a bright area and bias down slightly. Face (mid-tone): 0 EV (± for skin tone). Bright highlight you must keep: −⅓ to −⅔ EV. Highlight-weighted Prioritises brightest areas to prevent clipping. Stage/theatre, specular reflect ormers). Aim at the subject (skin, mid-tone). For highlight placement, meter a bright area and bias down slightly. Face (mid-tone): 0 EV (± for skin tone). Bright highlight you must keep: −⅓ to −⅔ EV. Highlight-weighted Prioritises brightest areas to prevent clipping. Stage/theatre, specular reflections, backlit edges, sunlit water. Compose; let the meter guard the highlights; raise ISO/open aperture to hold subject brightness. Often 0 EV; add light with exposure/ISO rather than positive comp.COMMON METERING SCENARIOSScenario Recommended mode Meter target / placement Suggested EV / settings Notes Backlit subject Spot or Centre-weighted Spot the face/subject (mid-tone) and lock exposure. +⅓ to +1 EV if using Matrix; Spot on face often needs little/no comp. Move closer/zoom to fill the spot with subject; add fill light if needed. High-contrast landscape (bright sky) Spot or Highlight-weighted Meter bright cloud/highlight you must keep. −⅓ to −⅔ EV from the spot reading to protect highlights. Bracket or use GND/merge HDR if shadows are too deep. Low light / interiors Spot or Centre-weighted Meter a true mid-tone (grey wall, skin in neutral light). Usually 0 EV; raise ISO or use tripod to keep safe shutter. Check histogram; avoid underexposure that lifts noise later. Stage / spotlight Highlight-weighted (or Spot) Let highlight-weighted protect the lit areas; with Spot, meter the lit skin. 0 EV (highlight-weighted). With Spot, start at −⅓ EV. Avoid clipping on faces; raise ISO to keep shutter fast. Bird against bright sky Spot Spot the bird (feathers); hold exposure. +⅓ to +⅔ EV if the bird is very dark; check blinkies on the sky. Use AF-C and a fast shutter (≥1/1000 s); expect bright background to blow slightly.* EV suggestions are starting points. Always confirm with the histogram and highlight warnings (“blinkies/zebras”).MATRIX VS CENTER-WEIGHTED METERING:Matrix Metering, also known as Evaluative Metering, is the default setting on most digital cameras metering modes. It analyses the entire frame by dividing it into multiple zones, assessing each for light and dark tones. This mode is particularly effective for scenes where the focus point might not be the central feature, as it adjusts exposure based on a complex analysis of all zones. In contrast, Center-weighted Metering focuses primarily on the middle of the frame and its immediate surroundings, ignoring the corners. This method is advantageous when the subject is centrally located, such as in portrait photography, ensuring the subject is correctly exposed regardless of the background.SPOT VS HIGHLIGHT-WEIGHTED METERING:Spot Metering targets a very small area around the camera's focus point, typically covering 1-5% of the viewfinder area. This precision makes it ideal for high-contrast situations where the subject is small and significantly differs in brightness from the background, such as in bird photography. On the other hand, Highlight-weighted Metering is designed to protect the highlights in an image from being overexposed. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios with bright spots, such as stage lights or reflections on water, ensuring that these highlights do not lose detail.COMMON METERING SCENARIOS - WHAT IS METERINGIn photography, accurately metering a scene ensures that the camera captures images with the desired exposure, especially in challenging light conditions. Here are some common metering scenarios and how to handle them:BACKLIT SUBJECT ot lose detail.COMMON METERING SCENARIOS - WHAT IS METERINGIn photography, accurately metering a scene ensures that the camera captures images with the desired exposure, especially in challenging light conditions. Here are some common metering scenarios and how to handle them:BACKLIT SUBJECTSBacklit subjects often create a dramatic effect but pose exposure challenges. The camera's meter typically reads the bright background, leaving the subject in shadow. To counter this, using spot metering allows the photographer to measure light from the subject itself rather than the background. By moving closer to the subject or zooming in, one can isolate the subject's lighting from the background. This approach ensures that the subject is well-exposed, highlighting details that might otherwise be lost in silhouette.HIGH CONTRAST SCENESScenes with high contrast, such as a bright sky against a dark landscape, require careful metering to avoid losing detail in shadows or highlights. Spot metering is advantageous here as it allows photographers to select a specific area of the scene to base the exposure on. This is particularly useful when the subject is smaller or significantly different in brightness compared to the background. Adjusting the exposure manually after spot metering ensures that the subject is neither overexposed nor underexposed.LOW LIGHT CONDITIONSLow light photography can be tricky as cameras may struggle to find the right exposure, often resulting in underexposed images. In such scenarios, spot metering can be beneficial by allowing photographers to meter off a middle-toned area within the scene. This method helps in achieving a balanced exposure. Additionally, using the camera's LCD monitor to check and adjust exposure in real-time can be a valuable technique. This immediate feedback helps in making quick adjustments to ensure the scene is captured as intended, especially when working with varying light conditions in landscape photography.ADVANCED METERING TECHNIQUES - WHAT IS METERINGMASTER METERING: MODES & TONE PLACEMENTDownload the 1-page Metering Field Checklist for fast tone placement and highlight protection.Download Metering Checklist (PDF) Image Reviews Clinic (Zoom, £29) 1-to-1 Zoom Help Prefer a text link?

However, these elusive companions hold the key to unlocking a world of depth, intrigue, and artistic expression. Embrace the interplay of light and darkness, and you'll discover a captivating genre that will elevate your imagery to new heights: shadow photography.UNVEILING THE ESSENCE OF SHADOW PHOTOGRAPHYAt its core, shadow photography revolves around the intentional and creative utilisation of shadows within a composition. It's a celebration of the absence of light, where darkness becomes a canvas for storytelling, mood-setting, and visual intrigue. Whether you make shadows the focal point or employ them as supporting elements, this art form empowers you to transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary masterpieces.THE INTERPLAY OF LIGHT AND SHADOWBefore delving into the intricacies of shadow photography, it's crucial to understand the fundamental relationship between light and shadow. Shadows are born when an object obstructs the path of light, casting a silhouette on the surrounding surfaces. The shape, intensity, and even colour of these shadows are influenced by the angle, direction, and temperature of the light source.By mastering the manipulation of light, you gain control over the shadows it casts, enabling you to sculpt of light, casting a silhouette on the surrounding surfaces. The shape, intensity, and even colour of these shadows are influenced by the angle, direction, and temperature of the light source.By mastering the manipulation of light, you gain control over the shadows it casts, enabling you to sculpt and shape your compositions with precision. This symbiotic dance between light and shadow is what breathes life into your images, imbuing them with depth, contrast, and a sense of drama that captivates the viewer's eye.HARNESSING THE POWER OF SHADOWSWhile some photographers may view shadows as unwanted elements, in the realm of shadow photography, they become the stars of the show. By harnessing their power, you can elevate your imagery to new heights, creating visually striking compositions that leave a lasting impression.ADDING DEPTH AND DIMENSIONHighlights may guide the viewer's gaze, but shadows are the unsung heroes that lend depth and dimension to your photographs. Without them, your images may appear flat and lacking in true focal points. Shadows provide a sense of three-dimensionality, enhancing the perceived volume and texture of your subjects, and creating a more immersive viewing experience.CRAFTING MOOD AND ATMOSPHEREShadows are not mere byproducts of light; they are powerful tools for setting the mood and atmosphere of your photographs. Crisp, angular shadows can evoke a sense of drama and tension, while soft, diffused shadows can imbue your images with a dreamlike, ethereal quality. By carefully controlling the interplay of light and shadow, you can guide the viewer's emotions, transporting them to the narrative you've envisioned.TRANSFORMING THE ORDINARY INTO THE EXTRAORDINARYOne of the most captivating aspects of shadow photography is its ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. Everyday objects, when cast in a strategic play of light and shadow, can take on new life, revealing patterns, shapes, and textures that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. This genre encourages you to see the world through a different lens, unveiling the beauty that lies hidden in the shadows.MASTERING THE TECHNIQUES OF SHADOW PHOTOGRAPHYNow that you've glimpsed the potential of shadow photography, it's time to delve into the techniques that will elevate your skills and unlock your creative potential.UNDERSTANDING LIGHT DIRECTION AND QUALITYThe direction and quality of light play a pivotal role in shaping the shadows you capture. By adjusting the angle of your light source, whether natural or artificial, you can sculpt the shadows to your liking. High, low, front, side, or backlit setups each yield unique shadow patterns, allowing you to experiment and discover the perfect configuration for your desired outcome.Additionally, the size and distance of your light source influence the quality of the shadows, ranging from hard and crisp to soft and diffused. Mastering these variables will empower you to create shadows that complement your artistic vision, whether you seek drama, subtlety, or a harmonious blend of both.EMBRACING NATURAL LIGHTFor those who prefer to work with the ever-changing dance of natural light, shadow photography offers a wealth of opportunities. The golden hours, those magical moments around sunrise and sunset, are prime times for capturing long, dramatic shadows that add depth and intrigue to your landscapes, cityscapes, and architectural compositions.However, don't be det tural light, shadow photography offers a wealth of opportunities. The golden hours, those magical moments around sunrise and sunset, are prime times for capturing long, dramatic shadows that add depth and intrigue to your landscapes, cityscapes, and architectural compositions.However, don't be deterred by the midday sun; its harsh, overhead light can be a powerful ally in creating sharp, crisp shadows that accentuate textures and geometric forms. Experiment with side-lit situations, where you position your subject perpendicular to the sun's rays, and witness how the shadows transform ordinary scenes into captivating works of art.MANIPULATING ARTIFICIAL LIGHTWhile natural light is a beautiful canvas, artificial light sources offer unparalleled control and flexibility. In a studio setting, you can meticulously shape and position your light sources to create shadows that align with your artistic vision. From a single key light to intricate multi-light setups, the possibilities are endless.Experiment with light modifiers, such as softboxes, grids, and gobos, to introduce patterns, shapes, and textures into your shadows. These tools not only add visual interest but also allow you to frame and highlight your subjects in unique and compelling ways.EMBRACING CONTRAST AND MONOCHROMEShadows inherently create contrast, and one of the most effective ways to accentuate this contrast is by embracing the world of black and white. Monochrome photography strips away the distraction of colour, allowing you to focus solely on the interplay of light and shadow.By converting your images to black and white, either in-camera or during post-processing, you can amplify the dramatic impact of your shadows, creating striking compositions that demand attention. This technique is particularly powerful in genres such as street photography, architectural photography, and fine art photography, where shadows can become the primary storytellers.EXPLORING CREATIVE COMPOSITIONSShadow photography presents a unique opportunity to explore creative compositions that challenge the conventional boundaries of photography. From silhouettes to abstract shapes, the possibilities are limitless.Experiment with framing your subjects using shadows, creating intriguing negative spaces that draw the viewer's eye. Incorporate patterns and textures formed by shadows, adding depth and visual interest to your compositions. Or, take a bold step and make the shadow itself the subject, capturing its intricate form and allowing it to take centre stage.MASTERING POST-PROCESSING TECHNIQUESWhile the magic of shadow photography often begins in-camera, post-processing techniques can elevate your images to new heights. Embrace the art of dodging and burning, selectively brightening or darkening specific areas to enhance contrast and emphasise your desired focal points.Experiment with adjustment layers, curves, and levels to fine-tune the balance between light and shadow, ensuring that your compositions strike the perfect harmony. Additionally, consider exploring advanced techniques such as compositing and blending, allowing you to combine multiple exposures and create surreal, imaginative scenes that blur the lines between reality and fantasy.EMBRACING CREATIVITY AND EXPERIMENTATIONAbove all, shadow photography is a journey of self-expression and creative exploration. Embrace experimentation, push boundaries, and challenge yourself to see the world through a new , imaginative scenes that blur the lines between reality and fantasy.EMBRACING CREATIVITY AND EXPERIMENTATIONAbove all, shadow photography is a journey of self-expression and creative exploration.

Accidents and unforeseen circumstances can happen, and having insurance coverage can provide peace of mind. * Look for policies offering camera equipment coverage, liability, and trip cancellations. Discuss your insurance needs with a reputable provider to ensure you are adequately protected. * In addition, it's essential to have emergency contact information readily available. Write down emergency contact names and numbers and include any critical medical conditions. Place this information in a sealed \" emergency \" envelope inside your camera bag. This simple step can be a lifesaver in case of an emergency.2. FITNESS: ASSESS YOUR CAPABILITIESBefore diving into the world of landscape photography workshops, it's crucial to assess your fitness capabilities. The physical demands of workshops can vary, from easy walks on even terrain to more challenging hikes in rugged landscapes.To ensure that you can fully participate and enjoy the experience, it's essential to be honest with yourself about your current physical abilities. This will help you determine if you need to train or make any necessary preparations before the workshop.While instructors are available to answer your questions and offer guidance, it ultimately falls on you to ensure that you are up to the challenges of the workshop.All our workshops are rated for fitness and are shown on the workshop details page on the website: 1. Fitness level Required - Easy: This trip is rated as easy, meaning that most people should comfortably be able to deal with the short walks (10-15mins) and occasional steps or gradients involved and on your feet for the duration of the workshop. 2.

Fitness level Required - Hard: This trip is rated as hard, meaning that most people with average fitness should be able to deal with longer walks (30-60mins) and frequent steps and gradients involved. 3. TRAVEL: DETERMINE THE TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTSPreparing for Your Photography Workshop involves knowing the travel arrangements with your instructor or workshop organiser is essential. * Find out if transportation is provided to the capture locations or if you need to arrange your own. If you are responsible for transportation, ensure that your vehicle is suitable for narrow lanes, limited parking, and sometimes off-road locations, in case they are part of the itinerary. You can make the necessary arrangements and eliminate potential logistical challenges by clarifying these details.4. PREPARATION: ARRIVING READY FOR SUCCESSArriving at your photography workshop or trip prepared and in the right mindset is crucial for a productive learning experience. Here are a few tips to help you arrive ready for success: * Plan Your Tra cal challenges by clarifying these details.4. PREPARATION: ARRIVING READY FOR SUCCESSArriving at your photography workshop or trip prepared and in the right mindset is crucial for a productive learning experience. Here are a few tips to help you arrive ready for success: * Plan Your Travel Time: Plan your travel time to avoid unnecessary stress. Aim to arrive at least 15-20 minutes early, allowing yourself ample time to settle in and mentally transition from your journey to the learning environment. * Familiarise Yourself with the Itinerary: Review the workshop itinerary to understand the schedule and locations you will visit. This will help you mentally prepare and ensure you have the equipment and supplies for each location. * Check Your Gear: Conduct a thorough gear check before leaving for the workshop. Ensure that your camera, lenses, batteries, memory cards, and other essential equipment are in working order and ready to be used. * Pack Accordingly: Depending on the workshop location and duration, you may need to pack additional items such as rain gear, extra layers of clothing, or specialised equipment. Be sure to check any specific packing recommendations provided by your instructor. * Bring an Open Mind: Approach the workshop with an open mind and a willingness to learn. Be receptive to feedback and guidance from your instructor and fellow participants. Embrace the opportunity to expand your knowledge and skills.5. CAMERA SETTINGS: KNOW HOW I’LL TEACH YOU THE WHY.Losing precious time in the field due to struggles with camera settings can be detrimental to your photography journey. Missing out on crucial shots and being preoccupied with figuring out how to adjust your camera settings can hinder your progress. That's why it's essential to have a solid grasp of various functions and know how to change them even if you don’t know why and when at this stage. During our workshops, you will be given assistance and training on why and when to use these functions. * Transitioning from multipoint or zonal focus areas to a single point, both in the viewfinder and live view screen. * Utilising Aperture and Shutter Priority modes effectively while making necessary adjustments such as exposure compensation. * Mastering the art of selecting the appropriate aperture, shutter speed, and ISO for optimal results. * Taking advantage of features like live view histogram or exposure metering (if available) for precise exposure control. * Enhancing composition by utilising electronic level/virtual horizon along with gridlines in live view mode. * Analysing image playback using histograms for accurate assessment during post-processing stages. * Adapting white balance presets or creating custom white balance configurations depending on lighting conditions. * Employing self-timers (2, 5, or 10 seconds) as an effective tool against camera shake during long exposures or self-portraits. * Setting auto-bracketing functionality (AEB) for taking multiple exposures (3 or 5) at different stop intervals – ideal for high dynamic range situations. * Exploiting features like live view zoom-in capability for achieving pinpoint focus accuracy.6. RESEARCH: VISUALISATION IS KEYOne of the most powerful tools in a photographer's arsenal is the ability to visualise the shots they hope to capture. During your planning and preparing for your photography workshop, take the time to plan the area and envision the pinpoint focus accuracy.6. RESEARCH: VISUALISATION IS KEYOne of the most powerful tools in a photographer's arsenal is the ability to visualise the shots they hope to capture. During your planning and preparing for your photography workshop, take the time to plan the area and envision the images you want to create. * Landscape photography captures the natural environment's essence and evokes the viewer's emotions. To achieve this, three crucial components are required: * identifying an exceptional location, * being present during optimal conditions, * and patiently waiting for the perfect moment when the lighting and surroundings align harmoniously. * By visualising your shots ahead of time, you can better prepare yourself to capture those breathtaking images.7. OPEN-MINDED: BE OPEN TO NEW EXPERIENCESStepping outside your comfort zone is often the catalyst for incredible growth and the creation of your best work. * Embracing new experiences during landscape photography workshops can push you beyond your creative boundaries and help you discover new techniques and perspectives. * While it may be daunting at first, getting comfortable with trying new things will open up a world of possibilities and potential for remarkable photographs. * As you delve into your photography workshop preparation, embrace the unfamiliar and be open to the transformative power of new experiences.8. PREPARE: YOUR LEARNING OBJECTIVESTo make the most of your photography workshop, thinking and preparing for your photography workshop outcomes are essential: Have clear learning objectives. * What specific skills or techniques do you want to improve? * What aspects of landscape photography do you want to explore further? By identifying your learning objectives, you can focus your attention and make the most of the educational opportunities provided during the workshop. * Please write down your objectives and bring them to the workshop, ready to discuss and seek guidance from your instructor. This will help you stay focused and ensure you come away from the experience with tangible improvements in your photography skills.9. ON THE DAY: CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING AS A PHOTOGRAPHERAttending a photography workshop or trip is just the beginning of your journey as a photographer. It's essential to recognise that learning and growth are lifelong pursuits. Having taken time meticulously planning and preparing for your photography workshop, it’s important to maximise your time on the event with a mixture of problem-solving yourself and also using the workshop resources: Here are a few ways to continue evolving and expanding your skills beyond the workshop: * Ask your workshop tutor for advice: Seek help with camera settings, equipment, techniques and composition. * Seek Feedback: Ask your workshop tutor for feedback on images taken, share your work with others, and seek ideas from trusted mentors or peers. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills. * Experiment and Innovate: Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles, techniques, and equipment. Embrace innovation and find your unique voice as a photographer. * Stay close: to the group and workshop leader so you can easily exchange ideas, seek help and gain input. * Adapt to new challenges: Problem-solving, whether technical or creative, is part of your enjoyment and evolution as a ph . Embrace innovation and find your unique voice as a photographer. * Stay close: to the group and workshop leader so you can easily exchange ideas, seek help and gain input. * Adapt to new challenges: Problem-solving, whether technical or creative, is part of your enjoyment and evolution as a photographer. * Spend enough time on a subject: and frame to work out how to solve the puzzle and share your thinking with the workshop leader for other suggestions.----------------------------------------PART TWO - HAVE THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT AND GEAR.Preparing for your photography workshop means knowing you have the right camera equipment and other gear to enable you to concentrate and get the most from your workshop. Part two of this comprehensive guide to preparing for your landscape photography workshop answers some of the most frequent scenarios, and questions asked.10. ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT: REQUIRED FOR WORKSHOPS.This is not an exhaustive or must-have list of items to attend and participate in our landscape photography workshops. However, you will find that most seasoned landscape photographers will all have the majority of these items. If you are new to landscape photography and still acquiring equipment, don’t fret just yet; usually, many items can be hired, loaned or just demonstrated on the workshop. Ask your workshop organiser if in doubt. I have included links where appropriate for you to purchase or hire items. * Sturdy Tripod – strong and light. Some workshop tours can provide loans of tripods for the duration of the workshop. Check with your workshop organiser. - My Recommendations * Tripod Head Camera/Lens Plates – You’ll need tripod plates for all your cameras and telephoto lenses (with collars) and the tools required to install and remove them. Amazon * Wired Remote Release Trigger – avoids using self-timer function but is essential for Bulb Mode when doing long exposures. They are inexpensive and a worthwhile purchase. Amazon * Batteries – bring plenty of batteries for your cameras and chargers as well. I recommend at least two batteries a day if your trip involves being out for 8hrs or more, and if you are based at locations with limited electric power, you will want to get a power bank to recharge your batteries and bring your charger with you. * Lenses – for most landscape workshops, a wide-angle zoom (16-35, 17-35, 17-40), a general-purpose zoom lens (like 24-70 or 24-105), and a medium telephoto zoom (like 70-200) are perfect. There is also the option to hire a lens or lenses for your trip from various providers these days. * Filters – a circular polarizer (for cutting reflections) and a few ND filters (for long exposures) are helpful. For ND filters, bring a 3- or 6-stop, and a 10-stop. My workshop tours include a limited set of loan of filters for you to try. My Recommended Filters are Lee and Kase . * Memory Cards – have at least two of these in case of malfunction or for multi-day trips where you can’t download images to",

      "articleBody": "BEYOND A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA: UNLOCKING DSLR PHOTOGRAPHYTable of Contents ShowINTRODUCTIONIf you're eager to learn photography and take your skills beyond the casual snapshots captured with smartphones and basic point and shoot cameras, consider a DSLR photography course. Such a course can propel your passion for photography, overcoming the limitations of simpler devices. This article will delve into the advantages of upgrading to a DSLR camera from a point and shoot and the transformative impact of photography lessons. Embrace the journey of self-expression and unleash your creativity as you embark on an educational path to elevate your photographic prowess.Photography Classes WHY UPGRADE TO A DSLR CAMERA FROM A POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA?EMBRACING ARTISTIC CONTROLThe debate of point and shoot vs dslr and dslr vs phone camera often centers on control and quality. Upgrading to a DSLR from a point and shoot camera means gaining full control over your photography. With a DSLR, you can manually adjust settings like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, allowing you to capture images that truly reflect your vision. This level of control adds a unique and personal touch to your photographs, distinguishing them from the automatic modes of simpler cameras.HARNESSING THE POWER OF INTERCHANGEABLE LENSESDSLR cameras boast a significant advantage over point-and-shoots due to their interchangeable lenses, which stand in stark contrast to the be que and personal touch to your photographs, distinguishing them from the automatic modes of simpler cameras.HARNESSING THE POWER OF INTERCHANGEABLE LENSESDSLR cameras boast a significant advantage over point-and-shoots due to their interchangeable lenses, which stand in stark contrast to the best-fixed lens camera. The difference between DSLR and point and shoot is also highlighted by the versatility of DSLR lenses, allowing photographers to experiment with various perspectives. From wide-angle lenses for expansive landscapes to telephoto lenses that bring distant subjects into view, and macro lenses that reveal intricate details, a DSLR opens up a world of creative potential.CAPTURING SUPERIOR IMAGE QUALITYWhen it comes to digital photography, DSLR cameras are renowned for their superior image quality, thanks to larger image sensors. These sensors offer better light sensitivity, less noise, and an enhanced dynamic range, enabling you to capture images with more detail, richer colours, and impressive performance in low-light conditions. No matter the subject, be it landscapes, portraits, or still life, a DSLR camera ensures your photographs are a cut above the rest.WHAT IS A DSLR CAMERA?What is a DSLR camera? A DSLR camera, also known as a digital single-lens reflex camera, is a type of camera that uses a mirror and prism system to allow the photographer to see exactly what will be captured by the camera's sensor. This type of camera is popular among professional photographers and photography enthusiasts due to its versatility and ability to produce high-quality images. DSLR cameras offer a wide range of features and settings, allowing photographers to have full control over their images. They typically have interchangeable lenses, which means that photographers can choose the lens that best suits their needs for a particular shot. DSLR cameras also offer manual controls, allowing photographers to adjust settings such as aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to achieve the desired exposure and creative effects. In addition, DSLR cameras often have larger image sensors compared to other types of cameras, resulting in better image quality, especially in low-light conditions. With the advancement of technology, DSLR cameras have become more accessible and affordable, making them a popular choice for both professionals and hobbyists alike. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced photographer, a DSLR camera can provide you with the tools and capabilities to capture stunning photographs. So, if you are interested in photography and want to take your skills to the next level, consider investing in a DSLR camera. It will open up a whole new world of creative possibilities and allow you to capture moments in a way that truly reflects your vision and style.DSLR CAMERA VS MIRRORLESSDSLR (Digital Single-Lens Reflex) cameras and Mirrorless cameras are two popular options for photographers. Both types of cameras have their own unique features and advantages, making it important for photographers to understand the differences between them. * DSLR cameras have been around for a long time and are known for their reliable performance and high-quality images. They use a mirror and prism system to reflect light into the optical viewfinder, allowing photographers to see exactly what the lens sees. This optical viewfinder provides a clear and real-time preview of the scene, making it easier for photographers to compose their shots. and high-quality images. They use a mirror and prism system to reflect light into the optical viewfinder, allowing photographers to see exactly what the lens sees. This optical viewfinder provides a clear and real-time preview of the scene, making it easier for photographers to compose their shots. DSLRs also offer a wide range of lens options, allowing photographers to choose the best lens for their specific needs. * On the other hand, Mirrorless cameras are relatively new to the market but have gained popularity in recent years. As the name suggests, these cameras do not have a mirror or prism system. Instead, they use an electronic viewfinder (EVF) or the LCD screen to display the image. This electronic viewfinder provides a digital preview of the scene, which some photographers find more convenient and accurate. Mirrorless cameras are also generally smaller and lighter than DSLRs, making them more portable and easier to carry around. * In terms of image quality, both DSLRs and Mirrorless cameras can produce stunning photos. DSLRs typically have larger sensors, which can result in better low-light performance and higher image quality. However, Mirrorless cameras have been catching up in this aspect, with some models now offering full-frame sensors that rival those found in DSLRs. * Autofocus is another important factor to consider. DSLRs traditionally have had faster and more accurate autofocus systems, thanks to their dedicated phase-detection autofocus sensors. However, Mirrorless cameras have made significant advancements in autofocus technology, with some models now offering hybrid autofocus systems that combine phase-detection and contrast-detection autofocus. This allows for faster and more precise autofocus performance, especially when tracking moving subjects. * When it comes to video recording, Mirrorless cameras often have the upper hand. They are designed with video capabilities in mind and offer features like 4K recording, in-body image stabilization, and focus peaking. DSLRs, on the other hand, may have limitations when it comes to video, such as limited recording time and lack of in-body stabilization.In conclusion, both DSLR and Mirrorless cameras have their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the photographer's specific needs and preferences. Whether it's the optical viewfinder and extensive lens options of DSLRs or the compact size and advanced video capabilities of Mirrorless cameras, photographers have plenty of options to choose from in today's market.----------------------------------------CROP SENSOR VS FULL-FRAME SENSORWhen it comes to choosing a camera, one of the key factors to consider is the type of sensor it has. There are two main types of sensors: crop sensor and full-frame sensor. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and understanding the differences between them can help you make an informed decision. * A crop sensor, also known as an APS-C sensor, is smaller than a full-frame sensor. It captures a smaller portion of the image, resulting in a narrower field of view. This can be advantageous in certain situations, such as when shooting wildlife or sports, as it effectively magnifies the subject. Additionally, crop sensors tend to have a higher pixel density, which can result in sharper images. * On the other hand, a full-frame sensor is larger and captures a wider field of view. This can be beneficial for landscape photography or ldlife or sports, as it effectively magnifies the subject. Additionally, crop sensors tend to have a higher pixel density, which can result in sharper images. * On the other hand, a full-frame sensor is larger and captures a wider field of view. This can be beneficial for landscape photography or situations where you want to capture more of the scene. Full-frame sensors also tend to perform better in low-light conditions, as they have larger pixels that can gather more light. * When it comes to image quality, both crop sensor and full-frame sensor cameras can produce stunning results. However, full-frame sensors generally have an advantage when it comes to dynamic range and low-light performance. This is because they have larger pixels that can capture more detail and gather more light, resulting in less noise and better overall image quality. * Another factor to consider is the cost. Full-frame sensor cameras tend to be more expensive than crop sensor cameras. This is due to the larger size and higher manufacturing costs associated with full-frame sensors. However, the price difference has been decreasing over the years, making full-frame cameras more accessible to a wider range of photographers.In conclusion, the choice between a crop sensor and a full-frame sensor ultimately depends on your specific needs and budget. Both types of sensors have their own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these differences can help you choose the camera that best suits your photography style and goals.----------------------------------------THE BENEFITS OF PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONSSTRUCTURED LEARNING FOR BEGINNERSFor those new to the craft, photography courses offer a welcoming entry point into a world that may otherwise seem intimidating with its technical terms and complex gear.

A tripod with a horizontal centre column and a geared head is invaluable for overhead product photography. This review of The Best Product Photography Tripod evaluates the K&F 94\"/2.4m Overhead Camera Tripod paired with the K&F Concept 3-Way Geared Tripod Head, showcasing its features, performance, and how it compares to other models in the market.WHY A DEDICATED PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHY TRIPOD MATTERSProduct photography demands exacting standards. Achieving sharp, distortion-free images involves: 1. Stability: Prevents camera shake for crisp shots. 2. Precision: Ensures the camera is perfectly aligned with the product.The 94\"/2.4m Overhead Camera Tripod and the K&F Concept 3-Way Geared Tripod Head deliver on both fronts, making them an excellent choice for professional and aspiring product photographers.----------------------------------------KEY FEATURES OF THE 94\"/2.4M OVERHEAD CAMERA TRIPODThis tripod’s standout feature is its horizontal centre column, perfect for overhead shooting. Its highlights include: * Horizontal Centre Column Boom: Allows positioning the camera directly above the subject for flat lays and macro shots. * Robust Construction: Made of alum RHEAD CAMERA TRIPODThis tripod’s standout feature is its horizontal centre column, perfect for overhead shooting. Its highlights include: * Horizontal Centre Column Boom: Allows positioning the camera directly above the subject for flat lays and macro shots. * Robust Construction: Made of aluminium, the tripod supports up to 10kg (22lbs), accommodating professional DSLR and mirrorless setups. * Height and Flexibility: Extends to 2.4m (94”), offering excellent reach, while adjustable legs provide stability on uneven surfaces. * Detachable Monopod: Adds versatility, useful for photographers who also shoot on location.This tripod is a versatile and durable tool for both studio and on-location work.----------------------------------------BENEFITS OF THE K&F CONCEPT 3-WAY GEARED TRIPOD HEADThe K&F Concept 3-Way Geared Tripod Head brings precision to the setup. Its features include: * Three-Axis Control: Provides precise adjustments on pan, tilt, and roll axes for perfect alignment. * Smooth Operation: Fluid head movement ensures precise positioning without disruption. * Durable Build: CNC-machined aluminium alloy construction supports up to 6kg (13.2lbs), suitable for most cameras and lenses.This geared head is ideal for photographers who need meticulous control in their compositions.----------------------------------------REAL-WORLD TESTINGREAL-WORLD TESTING: PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICAL USEStraight out of the box, I ensured all the tripod joints were properly tightened. This is a common practice, as tripods often arrive with detachable components slightly loosened to make users aware they can be swapped or adjusted. The 94\"/2.4m Overhead Camera Tripod comes with a standard ball head, which performs adequately in general use. However, for this test, I specifically opted to pair it with the K&F Concept 3-Way Geared Head, and swapping the heads was a quick and straightforward process.TESTING THE HORIZONTAL ARM MECHANISMOne of my primary objectives was to test the functionality of the horizontal centre column. I was pleasantly surprised at how intuitive this feature was to use. The centre column consists of two sections, with the horizontal arm lifting seamlessly from within the main column. It then pivots effortlessly into the horizontal position. To maintain balance, I removed the hook from the bottom of the main centre column and reattached it to the head of the horizontal arm. This allowed me to add counterweight, which is essential when using heavier camera equipment.STABILITY WITH HEAVY GEARFor the test, I mounted my Sony mirrorless camera paired with a 70-200mm lens, resulting in a combined weight of 1.6kg. Without a counterweight on the opposite end of the horizontal arm, the setup would have been prone to toppling. By properly counterbalancing the arm, I was able to extend it fully to the stop mark without any stability issues.PERFORMANCE OF THE 3-WAY GEARED TRIPOD HEADWith my camera securely mounted and positioned for overhead shots, the K&F Concept 3-Way Geared Tripod Head excelled in providing precise adjustments. Small tweaks to the composition were smooth and secure, with no fear of the camera slipping or instability. Even with the camera positioned directly over the product at a 180-degree angle, the setup felt solid and dependable.OVERALL IMPRESSIONSSetting up the tripod was quick and hassle-free, and transitioning to the horizontal arm position was straightforward. f the camera slipping or instability. Even with the camera positioned directly over the product at a 180-degree angle, the setup felt solid and dependable.OVERALL IMPRESSIONSSetting up the tripod was quick and hassle-free, and transitioning to the horizontal arm position was straightforward. The combination of the tripod and the 3-way geared head made photographing products from top-down angles and various other perspectives a seamless experience. The stability, ease of use, and precision adjustments provided a professional-grade solution for overhead product photography.HOW THIS SETUP EXCELS IN PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHYOverhead Shooting Made EasyIn studio testing, the setup performed exceptionally for flat lay photography. The horizontal column made it easy to frame items precisely, while the geared head enabled fine adjustments. Even with heavier equipment, the tripod remained stable, producing sharp images with no need for additional post-production alignment. The horizontal centre column allows for true overhead shots while maintaining stability. The locking mechanism keeps the column secure, even with heavy cameras. The geared head ensures the lens aligns perfectly perpendicular to the product, avoiding distortion.----------------------------------------EASE OF USE AND PORTABILITYDespite its professional-grade features, the tripod is straightforward to use: * Setup and Adjustment: The horizontal column transitions smoothly, and the geared head allows precise adjustments without hassle. * Portability: While heavier than travel tripods, the detachable monopod and foldable design make it suitable for location shoots.Its weight may be a limitation for those prioritising ultra-portable setups, but its functionality outweighs this drawback for studio use.----------------------------------------HOW IT COMPARES TO OTHER PRODUCT PHOTOGRAPHY TRIPODSTo understand its value, let’s compare this setup with other popular options on the market.FeatureK&F 94”/2.4m Overhead Camera Tripod + K&F 3-Way HeadManfrotto 055XPRO3 + XPRO 3-Way HeadK&F Concept 76\" Camera TripodGitzo Explorer SeriesPriceMid-range (£250-£300)High-end (£400-£450)Mid-range (£150-£200)Premium (£600-£800)Build MaterialAluminiumAluminiumAluminiumAluminiumMax Height2.4m (94”)1.7m (67”)1.93m (76”)1.6m (63”)Weight Capacity10kg (22lbs)8kg (17.6lbs)10kg (22lbs)8kg (17.6lbs)Geared Head FunctionalityYes, 3-axisYes, 3-axisNo, ball headNo, ball headHorizontal Centre ColumnYesYesYesYesPortabilityModerate (detachable monopod)ModerateModerateModerateBest ForStudio and overhead product photographyProfessional studio workOverhead and macro photographyCreative compositions ----------------------------------------WHY THE 94” OVERHEAD CAMERA TRIPOD STANDS OUTThe K&F 94” tripod offers an excellent balance of functionality, price, and versatility.

      "articleBody": "REVIEW OF KENT FAITH CONCEPT SQUARE FILTER SYSTEM PRO KITTable of Contents ShowINTRODUCTION - K&F (KENT FAITH) CONCEPT SQUARE FILTER SYSTEM PRO KITWhen it comes to landscape photography and creative long-exposure shots, filters play a critical role in controlling light, reducing reflections, and enhancing colours. If you're looking for the best filter kits for landscape photography, the Kent Faith (K&F) Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit is a versatile solution designed for photographers seeking flexibility and high performance.This review will cover everything included in the kit, the function of each filter, and how it can help elevate your landscape photography.WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE K&F CONCEPT SQUARE FILTER SYSTEM PRO KIT?The K&F Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit includes the following key items: 1. 95mm Circular Polariser (CPL) 2. ND1000 Filter (10-stop) 3. ND64 Filter (6-stop) 4. ND8 Filter (3-stop) 5. Four adapter rings (67mm, 72mm, 77mm, and 82mm) 6. Filter holder 7. Leather filter pouches 8. Dimensions of the filter pouch: 120mm x 120mm x 40mm 9. Overall weight of the kit: Approximately 450g, making it lightweight and easy to carry on location shoots. Each of these elements serves a specific purpose in the kit, which we will explore in detail.The variety of filters included makes this one of the best filter kits for landscape photography, offering flexibility whether you’re shooting a sunrise, waterfall, or long- on location shoots. Each of these elements serves a specific purpose in the kit, which we will explore in detail.The variety of filters included makes this one of the best filter kits for landscape photography, offering flexibility whether you’re shooting a sunrise, waterfall, or long-exposure seascape.THE 95MM CIRCULAR POLARISER (CPL)One of the essential filters in this kit is the Circular Polariser (CPL). This filter is widely regarded as a must-have for landscape photography because it reduces reflections from non-metallic surfaces such as water and glass, making skies more vibrant by deepening the blues and adding contrast to clouds.When to Use the CPLFor landscape photographers, a CPL filter is invaluable. When shooting a reflective lake, this filter will allow you to cut through the glare, revealing details below the water’s surface. Similarly, it will enhance the colours of a dramatic sky, helping you capture stunning shots during golden hour.ND1000 FILTER (10-STOP)The ND1000 filter, which reduces light by 10 stops, is perfect for long-exposure shots. If you’re a landscape photographer aiming to capture the smooth motion of water or clouds, this filter is a game-changer. It allows you to extend your shutter speed in bright daylight, producing a silky effect in moving water.When to Use the ND1000A classic example is shooting a waterfall on a sunny day. The ND1000 filter will help you slow down your shutter speed to create the ethereal, flowing effect that’s so popular in landscape photography.ND64 FILTER (6-STOP)The ND64 filter offers a 6-stop reduction in light, providing more balance between light control and retaining detail. It’s less extreme than the ND1000, making it ideal for overcast days or when you want to maintain some movement detail in clouds or water.ND8 FILTER (3-STOP)The ND8 filter is the lightest of the filters included, offering a 3-stop light reduction. It’s perfect for low-light scenarios like dawn or dusk, where only minor light reduction is necessary.BUILD QUALITY AND DESIGNA key feature of the Kent Faith (K&F) Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit is its build quality. All filters are made from Japanese AGC glass, renowned for its clarity and durability. The multi-layer nano-coating on each filter reduces reflections and enhances image clarity, making it one of the best filter kits for landscape photography.One feature that many users appreciate is the plastic trim around the edge of each filter. This trim makes handling the filters easier by allowing you to avoid touching the glass directly, helping to prevent fingerprints on the filter surface. The trim also provides a degree of protection against small knocks and bumps, adding durability to the edges of the filters and making them more user-friendly, especially in outdoor environments.While the leather filter pouch included in the kit is of excellent quality, some users may find it to be quite large. The square filters themselves, along with their mounts, are bigger compared to other systems like the Kase Revolution magnetic kits. As a result, the pouch takes up considerable space in your camera bag. If you're already carrying a lot of gear, this might require you to either switch to a larger bag or reconsider what you bring along for shoots.The filter holder is crafted from aluminium alloy, which is both lightweight and sturdy. It ensures that there is no vignetting, even when using wide-angle lenses— already carrying a lot of gear, this might require you to either switch to a larger bag or reconsider what you bring along for shoots.The filter holder is crafted from aluminium alloy, which is both lightweight and sturdy. It ensures that there is no vignetting, even when using wide-angle lenses—a common issue in landscape photography.IN-FIELD TESTING AND EXPERIENCE OF USING THE K&F CONCEPT SQUARE FILTER SYSTEM PRO KITHaving tested the Kent Faith (K&F) Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit in various field conditions, its performance stands out for landscape photographers who require versatility and durability. Whether it was sunrise shoots, long-exposure seascapes, or shooting under challenging lighting conditions, the kit proved to be reliable but not without some usability challenges.----------------------------------------EASE OF USE IN FIELD CONDITIONSSwitching between filters in the field was not always straightforward. Attaching the field holder adapter to the adapter ring proved difficult, requiring multiple attempts to lock it securely. Even when it was attached, there were times when it didn't feel entirely secure, leaving a sense of uncertainty. Additionally, inserting and removing filters was challenging due to the tight slots, necessitating the use of two hands—one to support the lens and adapter holder, and the other to manage the filter. This made quick changes difficult, especially in fast-paced shooting environments.PERFORMANCE IN LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHYDuring long-exposure photography, the ND1000 filter performed exceptionally well, providing consistent results without introducing any noticeable colour casts, which can be a concern with lower-quality filters. Even in bright conditions, the ND filters allowed for extended exposure times, creating silky smooth water effects and beautifully blurred clouds, showcasing the true potential of high-quality glass filters.POLARISER EFFECTIVENESSThe Circular Polariser (CPL) significantly reduced glare and reflections in water and glass surfaces while enhancing the colours of the landscape. When used on sunny days, it improved the depth of the sky and provided greater contrast between clouds and the blue horizon. The polarising filter is embedded into the adapter holder and includes a small cogged wheel, allowing you to rotate the polariser to the correct position quickly and easily, without the need to touch the filter itself. This feature makes polariser adjustment faster and more convenient in the field.View fullsizeKase Polariser Left - Kent Faith Polariser Right - No noticeable differences other than minor colour shifts between the two filters, and a small shift in darker shadows on the K&F CPL - both on maximum polarisation strength for testing purposesDURABILITY AND CLEANINGGiven the outdoor nature of landscape photography, filters often come into contact with dust, water, and other elements. The K&F Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit performed well in harsh environments, with the AGC glass and nano-coatings ensuring that the filters were easy to clean and resistant to scratches, water, and oil. The plastic trim around the filters also provided additional protection, helping to absorb minor bumps and making the filters easier to handle in rough conditions. This durability was a major advantage during a coastal shoot where exposure to saltwater and sand was unavoidable.SUMMARY OF IN-FIELD TESTING * Ease of Filter Changes: Quick vided additional protection, helping to absorb minor bumps and making the filters easier to handle in rough conditions.

Can I use the K&F Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit on any lens?Yes, the kit includes adapter rings for 67mm, 72mm, 77mm, and 82mm lens threads. For other sizes, you can use step-up or step-down rings.2. Will these filters affect image quality?The filters are made from high-quality Japanese AGC glass, which maintains sharpness and clarity without introducing colour casts or distortion.3. Do these filters cause vignetting?No, the slim profile of the filters and the holder prevents vignetting, even when using ultra-wide-angle lenses.4. What is the difference between the ND8, ND64, and ND1000 filters?The ND8 reduces light by 3 stops, the ND64 by 6 stops, and the ND1000 by 10 stops. The higher the number, the more light is reduced, allowing for longer exposure times.5. Can I stack filters in this system?Yes, the Kent Faith Concept Square Filter System allows you to stack up to three filters, such as combining the CPL with the ND1000 for creative effects.With a combination of affordability, versatility, and build quality, the K&F Concept Square Filter System Pro Kit is undoubtedly one of the best entry-level or budget filter kits for landscape photography. However, while it delivers solid performance for the price, its usability—particularly around attaching the filter holder and changing filters—could be improved.

The plastic trim around the filters adds a welcome layer of protection and ease of handling. For budget-conscious photographers, it's an excellent option, though it doesn’t match the premium quality and ease of use offered by higher-end brands like Kase and Lee Filters.recommended-products Alan Ranger 27 October 2024Alan Ranger Photography essential gear guides LinkedIn0 [",

Depending on what kind of shots you want you create, you’ll need different types of filters.Polarising FiltersThese type camera filters are perfect if you’re plagued by unexpected reflections in water or glass. These work by reducing the amount of reflected light that passes through to your camera’s sensor and helps remove glare from reflective surfaces in your photos.You’ll notice when you use a polarising filter that the colours are far richer and intense; giving your photos greater depth and impact. Just be careful when using polarising filters in photography; with less light reaching your camera, the shutter speed will be reduced resulting longer exposures that may result in camera shake if hand-holding your camera.View fullsizePolariser used to removed some of the bright reflective light on the surface of the seaNeutral Density Camera FiltersA neutral density filter will reduce light uniformly over the whole frame. They are primarily used to help extend the exposure time to show a greater sense of movement in a shot, e.g., water or moving clouds.You may find that if you’re coming along to one of my outdoor photography workshop s over the summer, bringin y are primarily used to help extend the exposure time to show a greater sense of movement in a shot, e.g., water or moving clouds.You may find that if you’re coming along to one of my outdoor photography workshop s over the summer, bringing a neutral density filter will greatly aid you in your photography and experimentation of affects.Take a look a previous blog post on using Neutral Density Filters View fullsizea 10 Stop Neutral Density Filter (Lee Big Stopper) to slow the exposure time and remove detail from the seaGraduated FiltersGraduated density camera filters are there to help you balance the exposure between the brightest and darkest areas in the scene. We call this range of brightness values the \"dynamic range\" and the camera is limited to how big a range it can capture in a single exposure. These filters help you to reduce that range by placing a darkened filter over the brightest part of the scene. Looking at these filters, you’ll be able to see that half of the filter is clear and half is darkened.You’ll most likely be using these filters in landscape photography if you haven’t already. These are just three camera filters that can be utilised in photography to help bring that extra bit of life to your shots. If you think you’re ready to continue your photography journey, I’m running a number of intermediate’s photography courses throughout the year that you can get involved in.Filter come in many shapes and of course sizes to fit your specific lens diameter. If you would like to get some advice please contact me about which filters you need and where would be a good place to start.I have also arranged a special discount for my customers with Linhof Studios so you can purchase a discounted beginner's pack or opt for one of the more advanced kits that I have put together just for my students..

It can transport us to breathtaking locations and evoke a sense of wonder and awe. One location that has been a magnet for photographers is the stunning Lake District in the United Kingdom. With its majestic mountains, serene lakes, and picturesque valleys, the Lake District offers a plethora of opportunities for landscape photographers to create stunning images. Cumbria is where I really caught the photography bug. Whilst I had always used a camera, like most people when travelling, day outs etc is was in this majestic place I recognised that my images were not doing justice to the scenery and emotions I had about this stunning landscape. In this article, we will explore the secrets of Lake District photography and how joining a photographic holiday in the Lake District can enhance your skills and provide you with a truly enchanting experience. It may also be the catalyst, as it was for me nearly twenty years ago, to view landscape photography differently and consider what elements of the photographic process you need to improve on to create images that convey more than just a reference to a place in time.HOW MANY LAKES ARE THERE IN THE LAKE DISTRICT?Lake District, the bodies of water are known by different names such as \"lakes,\" \"wa differently and consider what elements of the photographic process you need to improve on to create images that convey more than just a reference to a place in time.HOW MANY LAKES ARE THERE IN THE LAKE DISTRICT?Lake District, the bodies of water are known by different names such as \"lakes,\" \"waters,\" \"meres,\" and \"tarns.\" Each term has a specific meaning, often rooted in local geography and history. Below is a detailed explanation of each type, along with the number of each found in the region.1. LAKES * Meaning: A lake is a large, deep body of freshwater, typically larger than other types of water bodies. Despite the region being called the Lake District, only one body of water is officially named a \"lake.\" * Number: There is 1 official lake in Cumbria. * Example: Bassenthwaite Lake is the only water body officially named \"lake.\"2. WATERS * Meaning: \"Waters\" are long, narrow bodies of water, often found in valleys and formed by glacial activity. They are typically connected to rivers and tend to be large, though not as deep as lakes. * Number: There are 4 major waters in the Lake District. * Examples: * Derwent Water * Ullswater * Wast Water * Thirlmere3. MERES * Meaning: A mere is a shallow body of water, often found at lower elevations and not as deep or as large as a lake. The term \"mere\" comes from Old English and typically refers to open water that has fewer inflows and outflows than lakes. * Number: There are 2 major meres in the Lake District. * Examples: * Windermere (the largest natural lake in England) * Buttermere4. TARNS * Meaning: A tarn is a small, mountain lake, often formed in a cirque (a hollow created by glacial erosion). Tarns are typically found at higher elevations and are much smaller than lakes or waters. They often have a tranquil, remote feel. * Number: There are over 100 tarns scattered across the Lake District. * Examples: * Stickle Tarn * Red Tarn * Blea TarnSUMMARY OF NUMBERS: * 1 lake (Bassenthwaite Lake) * 4 waters (Derwent Water, Ullswater, Wast Water, Thirlmere) * 2 meres (Windermere, Buttermere) * Over 100 tarnsIn total, Cumbria’s Lake District is home to 7 major lakes, waters, and meres, and over 100 tarns, each offering unique characteristics and picturesque scenes for exploration and photography.THE ALLURE OF LAKE DISTRICT LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHYThe Lake District, located in northwest England, is renowned for its unparalleled natural beauty. Its breathtaking landscapes have inspired countless artists and writers throughout history, and it continues to captivate photographers from around the world. The region boasts a diverse range of scenery, from the rugged peaks of Scafell Pike to the tranquil waters of Blea Tarn. Each season brings unique charm to the landscape, making the Lake District a paradise for photographers. Whether you are drawn to the vibrant colours of autumn, the ethereal mist of late summer, the snow of winter, or the blooming flowers of spring, the Lake District offers a wealth of opportunities to capture the magic of nature all year round.BENEFITS OF JOINING A PHOTOGRAPHIC HOLIDAYJoining a photographic holiday in the Lake District can be a game-changer for aspiring landscape photographers. These Lake District Landscape Photography holidays offer a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in the art of phot of nature all year round.BENEFITS OF JOINING A PHOTOGRAPHIC HOLIDAYJoining a photographic holiday in the Lake District can be a game-changer for aspiring landscape photographers. These Lake District Landscape Photography holidays offer a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in the art of photography while surrounded by the stunning landscapes of the Lake District. One of the greatest benefits of joining a photographic holiday is learning from experienced professionals. I have an intimate knowledge of the Lake District and can guide you to the best locations at the optimal times for capturing breathtaking images. I can provide valuable insights into composition, lighting, and post-processing techniques that will take your photography to the next level. Additionally, joining a photographic holiday allows you to connect with like-minded individuals who share your passion for photography. The camaraderie and shared experiences can be incredibly inspiring and push you to explore new creative horizons.CHOOSING THE RIGHT PHOTOGRAPHIC HOLIDAY IN THE LAKE DISTRICT * When choosing a photographic holiday in the Lake District, it is essential to consider several factors to ensure you have the best possible experience. Firstly, look for a holiday that caters to your skill level. Whether you are a beginner or an advanced photographer, options are available for every level of expertise. My photography workshop holidays are open to all levels of experience, and generally, my groups are always a mix of complete novice to more experienced photographers. * Consider the size of the group as well. Smaller groups often provide a more intimate learning experience, allowing for one-on-one interactions with the instructors. My group size is a now a maximum of four for residential photography holidays for two reasons. Firstly a practical one of meaning removing the stress of multiple cars finding locations or parking. Four clients means I can provide transport for everyone in one vehicle giving us total flexibility to divert from a destination if we see some interesting light or potential shots on route and it means clients don’t have the stress of trying to navigate to remote spots that can’t be found with a post-code and sat nav. * It is also essential to research the itinerary of the holiday. Look for a well-rounded program that includes a variety of locations and shooting conditions, as this will help you develop a diverse portfolio of images. My workshops are meticulously planned from sunrise to sunset with the right balance of how many locations, driving time, rest and eating time to ensure we don’t rush between as many spots as possible but also don’t spend more than the required time somewhere that clients become brain dead! * Where you stay and how comfortable is important. Locating close to key locations means easier access for those sunrise and sunset golden hours. I have used a variety of hotels across the region depending on where the main areas of focus have been but I have settled down for the last few years in the very cosy and characterful Ravenstone Manor House, which is based near the edge of Bassenthwaite Lake just north of Keswick. The food and hospitality are brilliant, and the rooms are clean and comfortable and have scenic views down to Bassenthwaite. * Finally, read reviews and testimonials from previous participants to get an idea of the quality of instruction and the overall satisfaction of past attendees. My feedba k. The food and hospitality are brilliant, and the rooms are clean and comfortable and have scenic views down to Bassenthwaite. * Finally, read reviews and testimonials from previous participants to get an idea of the quality of instruction and the overall satisfaction of past attendees. My feedback reviews are second to none and sometimes people question how I can achieve a 4.9 out of 5 with over 600 reviews in the last ten years? The answer is that I really care about my client experience and do everything I can to ensure that any issues are dealt with professionally and quickly. This includes being aware about individual client needs throughout the whole holiday experience.ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT FOR LAKE DISTRICT LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHYYou will need some essential equipment to capture stunning landscape photographs in the Lake District. Firstly, a sturdy tripod is a must-have. It will enable you to keep your camera stable, especially in low-light conditions or when shooting long exposures. A rangeof focal lenghts is also good for capturing the vastness or more intimate aspects of the landscapes. Additionally, a polarizing filter can be a game-changer in landscape photography. It helps reduce glare and reflections, enhances colours, and reduces highlights the details on the foliage and water. Lastly, don't forget to pack extra batteries and memory cards, as the captivating landscapes of the Lake District may tempt you to shoot more than anticipated and when working in early morning light the exposure times will be longer and drain the battery quicker.If you want advice on what equipment to take with you to the Lakes, send me an email or call me. Anyone booking my workshop will be sent a recommended equipment list in advance of the event date and I also have some items (tripods, filters) available for you to use so you don’t have to go out and spend additional money to do the workshop with me.COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES FOR STUNNING LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHSComposition is key to creating stunning landscape photographs that evoke emotions and tell a story. Here are some composition principles to remember when photographing the Lake District's landscapes. * The rule of thirds for dividing your frame into zones or leading lines and foreground interest are all basic composition techniques you will find in any standard mainstream book, article or guide to photography. However, they are only fundamental principles and should not be seen as some robotic method applied to every scene and situation. Designing and image composition is far more complex than some simple principles. Visual weight, light, texture, form, shape, and contrast all contribute equally to creating a balanced composition that avoids the unnecessary in the frame and concentrates on the critical subject and required amount of supporting props to tell the story. * You can improve your compositions dramatically by working alongside more experienced photographers and a professional who has developed that awareness over decades of practice and understanding. Learning to see and read a scene takes effort, time and patience. Blindly applying rules without reason doesn’t necessarily create a compelling image. Compelling images are made through the photographer’s own considerations and interpretations of their subject and their ability to distil that into a rectangular box that we call a photograph. * If you are someone who struggles with composition then spend ’t necessarily create a compelling image. Compelling images are made through the photographer’s own considerations and interpretations of their subject and their ability to distil that into a rectangular box that we call a photograph. * If you are someone who struggles with composition then spend more time studying the work of photographers work you like and identifying what it is about their images that you are drawn to. Have a conversation with them about the why more than the how and you will start to understand that composition is much more about how an individual sees something and less about camera settings, lenses, composition rules and gear.CAPTURING THE MAGIC OF DIFFERENT SEASONS IN THE LAKE DISTRICTThe Lake District is a region of ever-changing beauty, with each season bringing its own unique charm. To truly capture the magic of the different seasons, it is essential to plan your photographic outings accordingly. In autumn, the Lake District transforms into a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours as the leaves change. Look for locations with a mix of deciduous trees, such as Derwentwater or Buttermere, and capture the reflections of the colourful foliage in the still waters of the lakes. Winter adds a touch of ethereal beauty to the landscape, with frost-covered trees and snow-capped peaks. Embrace the cold and venture out early in the morning to capture the soft light and delicate patterns created by the frost. Spring brings a burst of life to the Lake District, with blooming flowers and lush greenery. Photograph the vibrant bluebells in Rannerdale or the daffodils in Ullswater to add a pop of colour to your images. Lastly, summer offers long days and golden sunlight. Make the most of the extended daylight hours and capture the dramatic sunsets and sunrises over the lakes and mountains.EDITING AND POST-PROCESSING TIPS FOR LAKE DISTRICT LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHYEditing and post-processing are essential steps in the landscape photography workflow. They allow you to enhance the mood and atmosphere of your images and bring out the full potential of the raw files. When editing your landscape photographs from the Lake District, it is important to balance realism and artistic interpretation. Start by adjusting the exposure, contrast, and white balance to achieve a natural-looking image. Then, focus on enhancing the colours and tones to create a harmonious and visually appealing result. Pay attention to details such as sharpening and noise reduction to ensure your images are crisp and free from distractions. Lastly, don't be afraid to experiment with different editing techniques and styles to add your unique artistic touch to the final images. I use a combination of Adobe Lightroom and the NIK plugins for my editing. Decades of image-making mean I have a quick and effective workflow to turn a RAW image into something that represents my interpretation. Reaching this point takes time and patience to learn how to use the tools on hand effectively and sensitively. Each image deserves the full attention you gave it in the making as it does in the post-production so don’t just hope that a few clicks on a preset will match artistic expression and job done, take the time to learn how to create the final image in a way that matches your intention.INSPIRING PHOTOGRAPHERS IN THE LAKE DISTRICTThe Lake District has been a muse for countless photographers throughout history.

      "articleBody": "TRIPODS – PHOTOGRAPHERS BEST FRIEND OR CREATIVITY STIFLERTRIPODS – A PHOTOGRAPHER’S BEST FRIEND OR CREATIVITY STIFLER?Our three legged friend is essential when it comes to small apertures, long exposure times and shooting in low light, however a tripod can also become a real stifler when it comes to being creative and having the freedom to move around - hand-holding the camera, unless you apply some simple but effective disciplines.There is no doubt that a tripod is essential for the majority of photography where apertures between F8 & F16 slow the exposure time down to less than 1/60 of second, the \"considered\" normal limit for hand-holding the camera. Combined with the desire for many outdoor photographers to shoot at dawn and dusk, because of the subtler light, you can quickly understand how the tripod is relied on to get a sharp shot.However, I have observed a trend or maybe just a beginner's trait, when leading outdoor workshops for over 3 years, that it's all to easy to allow the tripod to decide the position, height, angle, perspective of the next shot you take. Here's the scenario that I have witnessed on just about every workshop - person sets camera up on tripod then walks to chosen spot of interest and places tripod on ground. They then work the composition from that exact position they placed the tripod down - this is no different to the countless times I observe \"snappers\" walking around a town / place of interest with camera in hand and then im tripod then walks to chosen spot of interest and places tripod on ground. They then work the composition from that exact position they placed the tripod down - this is no different to the countless times I observe \"snappers\" walking around a town / place of interest with camera in hand and then immediately stop at the point they spot something and take the shot from exactly that position at that height and perspective - usually just using the zoom on the lens to adjust for framing. I call this the miracle spot! Miraculously they always seem to know where to stop to be in the perfect position to take the shot. I wish I had their instinct and eye for such perfect positioning every time!By deploying a couple of simple disciplines, you will improve your image making and stop the tripod becoming the determining factor.WHY TRIPODS ARE ESSENTIALDiscipline 1 - ObservationThe 10-20mins you spend observing and thinking about the design of your shot, the subject, light and narrative should determine how best to make that photograph. That investment in observation time is not just a waiting game for the sake of it - it achieves a number of things. * slows you down to pay more attention to all the visual elements and clues that you need to use to express your interpretation of the subject/scene * allows you to make a stronger connection to the subject which in turn hopefully translates to a more complete image * allows you examine and consider all the elements of designing your shot from camera craft and settings to placement and perspective.Discipline 2 - Hand hold the camera first * allows you work away from the tripod whilst you examine and work out the height and angle of the frame - you can bend, stoop, stretch and angle without any restriction (apart from your own flexibility) and then position the tripod in the \"perfect\" position.Of course, not every image needs tripods - after observing and hand holding you may find that you decide on a much wider aperture F2.8 to F5.6 or a fast enough shutter speed to hand-hold the shot without the restriction of then having to set the tripod up.Remember not all landscapes need to be shot at small apertures of F16, sometimes the shallow depth of field of F5.6 helps to create a separation of foreground and background that expresses the interpretation far more than having front to back focus. Mark Littlejohn (winner of landscape photographer of the year 2014) doesn't use a tripod that often , this enables him to be free to experiment and move around a scene quickly and effortlessly to capture that glimpsing light and mist in woodland scenes.SO THE NEXT QUESTION IS, WHAT TRIPODS?Well, that's a good question but not necessarily so easy to answer as everyone's needs are different. It depends on several factors: * height * weight * budget * stability * flexibilityView fullsizeTripod height conversion tableTRIPODS HEIGHT - TRIPOD LEGS COME IN A RANGE OF HEIGHTS - IDEALLY YOU NEED ONE THAT WHEN FULLY EXTENDED (WITHOUT USING THE CENTRE COLUMN - WHICH DESTABILISES THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION) REACHES YOUR CHIN - THIS ENABLES YOU TO GET THE TRIPOD HIGH ENOUGH FOR SHOTS REQUIRING IT, AND SAVES YOU A HUNCHED-BACK ISSUE IN YEARS TO COME FROM STOOPING OVER IT BECAUSE ITS TOO SHORT. * Make sure you check the height of the tripod (without centre column) before you buy. * Use this quick reference table I have put together to give you an approx idea of height needed to re IRING IT, AND SAVES YOU A HUNCHED-BACK ISSUE IN YEARS TO COME FROM STOOPING OVER IT BECAUSE ITS TOO SHORT. * Make sure you check the height of the tripod (without centre column) before you buy. * Use this quick reference table I have put together to give you an approx idea of height needed to reach about your chin level which means once you add the height of your tripod head and camera body it should approximately be at least eye level whilst standing straight.TRIPODS WEIGHT - MANY PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME THEY BROUGHT A CERTAIN MAKE OF TRIPOD BECAUSE IT'S LIGHT AND THEREFORE EASY TO CARRY AROUND. FAIR POINT BECAUSE THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN BUYING SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE DISCOURAGED FROM TAKING WITH YOU BECAUSE IT WEIGHS 2-5KG WITH THE HEAD ON IT. HOWEVER BUYING A LIGHTWEIGHT TRIPOD AND THEN DROPPING YOUR 400MM ZOOM LENS AND FULL SIZE DSLR ON IT, COMBINED WEIGHT 8KG, IS ALSO GOING TO END IN DISASTER AT SOME POINT AS THE \"LOAD\" IS UNBALANCED. * Make sure you check the maximum load weight for the tripod and head in the manufacturers specifications and work out your maximum load weight of your camera body and heaviest lens.TRIPODS BUDGET - WE ALL HAVE SOME LEVEL OF WHAT WE THINK WE CAN AFFORD AND OF COURSE RESTRICTION. MY EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH BEGINNER'S IS THAT THEY GENERALLY MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID WHEN I STARTED OFF BY GOING BY PRICE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE AND THEN REALISING SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE THAT THEY MADE THE WRONG CHOICE AND NEED TO RE-INVEST IN DIFFERENT TRIPOD. There are many price brackets from £120 to £800+. Buying the most expensive is not required because it really depends on the type of photography you do as much as anything else. Getting a system that matches your budget and the other 3 considerations takes a little time to work out but buying the right one first time will hopefully mean you keep and enjoy it for a long time to come. * Don't just think how much can i afford today - work out where your photography might lead and how much each of the 3 other considerations are a priority in your purchasing and using decision.TRIPODS STABILITY - THE WHOLE POINT OF A TRIPOD IS TO STABILISE THE CAMERA WHEN YOU HAVE LONGER EXPOSURE TIMES. OBVIOUSLY EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ARE VARIABLE DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE SHOOTING - IF LIKE ME YOU ARE OUT PHOTOGRAPHING IN ALL WEATHERS, WIND, RAIN, SNOW AND OFTEN ON HIGHER GROUND THEN THE CHANCES ARE YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE BUFFETING OF THE WIND AND ELEMENTS. This is where heavier tripods have an advantage as they are less likely to shake rattle and roll or in one case I saw a couple of year back actually take off in a gust of wind. However there are tripods that are lightweight and yet still very stable (Carbon Fibre) but they come at a price - worth the investment if you think you may regularly encounter the challenges of extremer weather. * If you have the opportunity, tap the legs of the tripod when fully extended and see if you can sense any vibration running along the tripod legs. If you can feel any vibration then you know the tripod is susceptible to vibration and this can lead to blurred shots in the windView fullsizeTRIPODS FLEXIBILITY - IF LIKE ME YOU WANT ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY WITH THE TRIPOD TO GET LOW DOWN TO THE GROUND OR INTO ODD POSITIONS THEN YOU NEED A SET OF TRIPOD LEGS THAT ALLOW GROUND LEVEL SHOOTING - THIS MEANS NO CENTRE COLUMN OR CERTAINLY THE ABILITY TO EASILY REMOVE OR ADJUST THE CENTRE COLUMN INTO A HORIZON BILITY - IF LIKE ME YOU WANT ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY WITH THE TRIPOD TO GET LOW DOWN TO THE GROUND OR INTO ODD POSITIONS THEN YOU NEED A SET OF TRIPOD LEGS THAT ALLOW GROUND LEVEL SHOOTING - THIS MEANS NO CENTRE COLUMN OR CERTAINLY THE ABILITY TO EASILY REMOVE OR ADJUST THE CENTRE COLUMN INTO A HORIZONTAL BOOM POSITION. LIKEWISE THE TRIPOD HEAD CAN ALSO MAKE THIS EASY OR IMPOSSIBLE TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. * Think about the range of shots you might want to take at different heights - decide if having a centre column is important for you - used for horizontal boom to position camera over the top of something or overhang over something you cant move to.MY RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHY...If you think you’re ready to invest you can check out my Amazon store . This store contains the tripods I recommend, plus more so you can expand on your photography kit.----------------------------------------The Gitzo GT3532 is a lovely tripod, legs only, its lightweight, works low and high and is easy to use with twist lock grips to expand and contract. It comes at a price because is carbon fibre, stable and flexible. Suited to outdoor conditions in all weathers.For me (5' 11\") is has more than enough height when fully extended with the head and camera body on top.Weight 1.8kg without a head----------------------------------------The MeFoto Globetrotter Carbon is my alternative tripod for when I am travelling abroad, or walking further distances or just need something much lighter.The carbon fibre version weighs just an incredible 3.7 pounds and reduces down to just 40cm when compact which makes it small enough to fit into any camera bag or luggage.It also converts quickly and easily into a monopod so perfect for travel photography.It comes with a ball head and carrying case and spikes as well as the standard rubber feet so is flexible, light and gives me the height needed when fully extended without needing to stoop - which so many travel tripods cause.MeFoto also do an aluminium version which weighs and extra pound at 4.7 pounds but is a lot cheaper at approx £170 - https://www.alanranger.com/photography-equipment Watch the YouTube Video Here: Note this is the Roadtrip not Globetrotter but similar enough to give you an idea.----------------------------------------https://www.alanranger.com/photography-equipmentThe Manfrotto 055 is my 3rd recommendation for those who want an entry level tripod that is flexible, stable but very affordable. Whilst is does not have the advantage of super light weight it makes up for it in terms of stability and flexibility. Its heavier than the MeFoto as weight 2.5kgs without a head attached. It also reaches a height of 140cm without the use of a centre column so suits everyone under 5' 10\" and the centre column can be repositioned for low level shots.My advice given the cost of a separate head and the overall weight would be to choose the MeFoto aluminium over this for pound to pound weight, height and budget but the Manfrotto for stability in extremer weather.----------------------------------------The Gitzo and Manfrotto do not come with tripod heads. This is another topic in it's own right - from experience of talking to beginners and advanced most people decide (eventually) that the gear heads are worth the money.They allow for fine and accurate movement of the camera positi -----------The Gitzo and Manfrotto do not come with tripod heads. This is another topic in it's own right - from experience of talking to beginners and advanced most people decide (eventually) that the gear heads are worth the money.They allow for fine and accurate movement of the camera position so you can really be precise with your composition, where as ball heads and 3 way levers can leave you getting frustrated by the amount of play in the head movement.My two recommendations are: * Manfrotto Junior Geared Head * Manfrotto 405 Pro Geared HeadBoth work the same way but of course the Junior is lighter, cheaper but I find slightly more tricky to use, on account of my fat fingers trying to rotate the knobs easily. From memory of talking to others I think there is also a restriction with the junior when it comes to positioning the head in a vertical format and when using the horizontal boom position of the centre column.https://www.alanranger.com/photography-equipmenthttps://www.alanranger.com/photography-equipment----------------------------------------All in all, I’d say every photographer should have at least one tripod they can rely on to take on any shoot in any weather or situation - the MeFoto excellent design, weight and flexibility is a great all rounder but if you expect to be doing some more rugged terrain stuff then the Gitzo and Manfrotto combinations will certainly not let you down.If you have your own preferences, experiences or recommendations I and the readers would be delighted to read about them so please join the conversation and post your comment below.

Suitable for basic shooting needs in less harsh environments or indoors. * I'd rate it 7/10.----------------------------------------КЕУ FЕАTURЕЅ: МАNFRОT aphers who prefer a more affordable option compared to carbon fibre tripods. * It's sturdier than previous travel tripods from Manfrotto.

He was after my two pence on whether he had the chops for an RPS Distinction. We kicked off with Alistair gunning for his Licentiateship, and he nearly nailed a final draft panel. But, we both felt it was about as representative of his style as a penguin in a tutu.After a bit of chin-wagging, Alistair decided to dive into my Intentions Photography Project Course. This turned out to be the springboard for a series of still-life images that would make even inanimate objects feel like celebrities.Then, wouldn't you know it, Covid gate-crashed our party and put the kibosh on the course schedule. Not to be deterred, Alistair pivoted back to my RPS Distinctions Mentoring Course, using his Intentions images as the foundation for an Associates Panel in Fine Art. Talk about making lemonade from lemons!The journey to the final 15 images was about as straightforward as a drunk octopus trying to put on rollerskates. But Alistair, bless him, stuck to it like a limpet. After more reshoots, re-edits, and meticulous critiques than you can shake a stick at, he finally had a panel ready for submission in June 2024.Alistair's panel is a proper corker, showcasing exactly what an Associates Panel should be. His unique style, editing prowess, and consistent ligh limpet.

His unique style, editing prowess, and consistent lighting make his chosen subject shine brighter than a diamond in a coal mine.I'm always chuffed to bits when my RPS students succeed, but this one's got me grinning like a Cheshire cat. Alistair's dedication is truly inspiring. Massive congrats, mate! Here's hoping you can flog all those props you bought, or Louise might end up auctioning your images on eBay! 😊----------------------------------------STATEMENT OF INTENT> GENERATIONS> > In our constantly changing world, the passage of time leaves its mark on everything, even the most mundane objects found in our homes. By juxtaposing ordinary household items from different eras, I wanted to explore the stories embedded within these artifacts and the role they play in shaping our collective memories. Many of the objects in my images belong to my children, myself, my parents and even my grandparents. The images therefore reflect the shifts in technology, design and familiar artefacts over the different generations of a family.> > 89 wordsINTERVIEW WITH ALISTAIR FOLLOWING HIS RPS DISTINCTIONS ACHIEVEMENT1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?A well-regarded award. I've been a keen photographer since I was about 10, but hadn't done any structured learning until my late 40s. I was originally aiming for an LRPS, but ended up going directly for the ARPS.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING COURSE?I'd been thinking of submitting for the LRPS in about 2017, and visited the Photography Show at the NEC that year. A leaflet had some comments about the value of finding a mentor before submitting, so I went on the internet. Alan's site came up so I called him, and after a discussion about my initial proposed panel, I started on the LRPS mentoring course.In fact, while preparing for the LRPS, I started developing a strong interest in still-life photography. Rather than finishing the LRPS submission, Alan then suggested building a project on his Intentions course, and my images for that ended up as the starting point for the ARPS mentoring course. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. Very good, although it can be a bit frustrating trying to find a slot when enough people will attend. On the other hand, it's tremendously valuable seeing other people's work, and getting the insights that come from Alan's critique of them, so it's worth the logistical difficulties.On paper, the classes seemed to be a bit short at first; nominally 30 minutes per attendee. However, Alan's very generous with that time (and doesn't cut short the final attendee if the earlier ones have overrun), and the amount of insight that he can pack into that time is extraordinary. Outside the mentoring classes, I regularly use the techniques that Alan used to critique either my images, or those of the other students. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes. 5. BEFORE YOU STARTED THE MENTORING COURSE, DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ALREADY GOOD ENOUGH TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS? I was a long way off the required le either my images, or those of the other students. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes. 5. BEFORE YOU STARTED THE MENTORING COURSE, DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ALREADY GOOD ENOUGH TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS? I was a long way off the required level when I started the ARPS course. However, I think that, following the Intentions course, we were confident that the core concept of my panel (different generations of household objects) was sound, and that I had the potential to develop a panel at the required level.In fact, I needed to do the course twice over about 4 years before the final panel was ready to my satisfaction and Alan's. (Although the pandemic and some personal circumstances did drag things out.) I think I needed that amount of time to get a feel for all the aspects of the work, especially understanding the composition, and the photo editing techniques that give the images their final feel. I wasn't in any rush to get the distinction, so had time to enjoy the journey.Working in still life is very unforgiving; a frequent comment from Alan and the RPS mentors I have spoken to, is that any mistake, no matter how minor, is your fault as everything is under your control. Although this can be frustrating, I also found that it forced me to gain mastery of many aspects of the photography, including how to use artificial light sources, and artistic techniques using the Nik collection.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?ARPS, and I was successful. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?Quite nerve-wracking... my panel was the last of the associate panels to be assessed, and many of the panels that day didn't make the cut. Fortunately, the assessors' comments on my panel were very positive and I was awarded the distinction.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? Yes; I arranged a one2one advisory session with an RPS mentor (who turned out to be one of the assessors of my panel). She was very helpful, and picked out some small slips in the images (minor ghosting artifacts, and some blown highlights) which had somehow managed to get past Alan. The RPS mentor was also very helpful with her comments on my statement of intent. Apparently, many candidates struggle to get this right, and her feedback on my first draft was that it was too impersonal; the assessors like to see something that explains the photographers' connection to their work. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?The phrase that the assessors used a lot for the was that the successful panels look like \"the work of one photographer\". Meaning that they are looking for a distinctive style, but which is consistent across the panel. The assessors also put a lot of emphasis on the statement of intent, and preferred statements which were about the content of the images (\"this topic means a lot to me because...\"), rather than about the technical aspects of the images (\"I wanted to explore this technique because...\")It is also worth exploring other guides and reference books in your chosen area of photography: I found Kevin Best's book \"Still Life Photography\" to be extremely inspiring, and gave me lots of ideas. Also, the Strobist blog (https://strobist.blogspot.com/) is an absolutely invaluable guide to using artificial light. ploring other guides and reference books in your chosen area of photography: I found Kevin Best's book \"Still Life Photography\" to be extremely inspiring, and gave me lots of ideas. Also, the Strobist blog (https://strobist.blogspot.com/) is an absolutely invaluable guide to using artificial light. I would have found preparing my panel far, far harder without these two sources of information. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?It's a bit prosaic, but the main difficulty I had was finding the time. Building up 15 high quality pictures which share a common theme is quite hard anyway, but then ensuring that they work together in a panel is an additional challenge. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Immensely so: my final panel is way beyond what I was doing when I started working for the distinction. It's very satisfying to look at some of the early attempts to see how much I've developed. 12.

In October 2023 she made the decision to go for it. Given the short timescales created by the withdrawal of print submissions for the L by the RPS, we had only a couple of months to select images and organise a panel ready for printing by Christmas 2023. Therefore, Barbara opted for Zoom 1-2-1 lessons rather than waiting for my RPS Distinctions Group Mentoring classes.Over the course of five 1hr Zoom sessions in relatively quick succession, we selected a shortlist of images for consideration and following, and RPS Advisory narrowed the selection down to the final ten and went about scrutinising each image for edits and refinements. Barbara also had to go out to make a couple of new images where we felt there were gaps in technique or subject diversity. Barbara managed to achieve those new images with just one or two outings and we were ready to embark on test prints and paper selection in early December.One Vision Imaging were extremely helpful in providing the test prints quickly. After some further discussions and refinements, the final ten images were ready for printin per selection in early December.One Vision Imaging were extremely helpful in providing the test prints quickly. After some further discussions and refinements, the final ten images were ready for printing by the end of the year.Barbara’s panel shows a good eye and technique for simplifying what she is observing to convey a story and ask the viewer to create an interpretation. As always, the RPS demands technical quality but also sympathetic treatment in post-processing to ensure that the light is balanced and images have balanced visual weight individually and overall as a panel of ten images. I am really proud that Barbara was courageous enough to go through the process in such a short space of time to achieve the accreditation. Importantly she has learned how to put a panel together too and treat every image with the care and attention in post-production as she did whilst taking them. Congratulations, Barbara; I look forward to supporting you more as you develop your passion and photography hobby.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH BARBARA FOLLOWING HER RPS DISTINCTIONS ACHIEVEMENT1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?I was actually talked into it by a friend who wanted support to gain the distinction. Many years ago, I had completed an A-level, resulting in an A*, which is equivalent to the LRPS distinction, so I thought I would try as well. By previously doing the A-level, I had some idea of what would be required, although without the support of a tutor.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING COURSE?I was already on Alan’s monthly mentoring scheme, so it was a natural progression to work towards the distinction with him. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. I found the mentoring extremely helpful; Alan is very knowledgeable about what exactly is required for the distinction; he helped with processing where required and went at a pace which was right for me. He gave advice about printing which was very helpful. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes, Alan was supportive in advising me about my images, arranging and rearranging the panel and printing 5. BEFORE YOU STARTED THE MENTORING COURSE, DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ALREADY GOOD ENOUGH TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS? When I first started mentoring with Alan, I was overconfident and felt I was up to the required standard. I was not. Alan then guided me to improve my photography and processing. I had intended to apply for the distinction after 6 months of mentoring, but due to RPS changing requirements, it happened much sooner. I then had to really focus on taking more photographs and going through my past photographs to produce a panel of the standard needed to gain the distinction.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?I applied for and gained the LRPS 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I attended on Zoom, I was quite nervous but also confident that Alan had guided me to do my best. It was one of the last print assessments and I felt the print submissions were of a higher quality compared with many of the digital submissions.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM AN ed on Zoom, I was quite nervous but also confident that Alan had guided me to do my best. It was one of the last print assessments and I felt the print submissions were of a higher quality compared with many of the digital submissions.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I attended an Advisory Day at RPS House which was very useful. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?Definitely get a mentor for guidance, and attend an Advisory Day or a One-to-One with the RPS. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?I was time-limited as I wanted to submit a Print Panel before the RPS changed to digital submissions only. This made the process a little stressful, but Alan helped to give me the confidence that I could be ready in time. Deciding on the panel as a whole and swapping images was at times trying, but I was able to achieve what was required with Alan’s guidance in the end. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Yes I feel my photography has improved immensely and I have more confidence. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD?I am not sure if I would have achieved the distinction without Alan's support and guidance. At times, I felt confident, and at other times, I did not. I felt I could rely on Alan’s knowledge to get me through the process. I was grateful that Alan took the time to see my prints printed before they were sent to me.----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining an RPS distinction I can support you with my RPS Courses for distinctions RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * ZOOM - ONLINE * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

We quickly agreed (somewhat reluctantly on Ian’s part, that whilst they all had merit individually, there needed to be a broader selection of subject matter, lighting, point of view and communication. It didn’t take long for us to work through a back portfolio of alternative images and genres to draft a panel of ten photos that could meet the criteria set by the RPS.Ian is pretty skilled in the editing aspect of things, so the suggested edits I made were quickly executed with a reasonable degree of skill. Once halos, dust spots, consistent aspect ratios and a few shadow/highlight or areas of dis panel of ten photos that could meet the criteria set by the RPS.Ian is pretty skilled in the editing aspect of things, so the suggested edits I made were quickly executed with a reasonable degree of skill. Once halos, dust spots, consistent aspect ratios and a few shadow/highlight or areas of distracting colour saturation were dealt with, he went on to have an online 1-2-1 with an RPS Assessor for preliminary feedback. Thankfully, the assessor’s feedback was positive, with a few minor tweaks and suggestions, and Ian was set to go following a couple of reviews with me on amendments. While I feel my experience is solid after twenty years of teaching and working alongside various photographic organisations for accreditation, I always prefer an independent second opinion before judgement day!Ian passed on the day, one of the few, who had opted for the DPI (Digital Projected Images) assessment. Sadly, in my view, the RPS only allows the Licentiate as a DPI and has removed the Printed Image option. Contrary to popular myth, this doesn’t make it more challenging; it just means more attention to image resolution and apparent issues with dust spots, halos and similar matters in image production. Well done, you, Ian. It's a great result and panel showcasing your versatility in photography. I look forward to supporting you in your next chapter and pursuing your Associate Accreditation.You can view more of Ian’s work on his website here: Slater Photography.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH IAN FOLLOWING HIS RPS DISTINCTIONS ACHIEVEMENT1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?I see photography as my creative outlet and, rightly or wrongly, I felt that the journey to become a Licentiate of the RPS was an opportunity to learn, develop and push myself beyond my comfort zone. It has been all those things and more.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING COURSE?I had tried and failed the LRPS assessment twice before contacting Alan. I had not worked with him before but half the battle is knowing when (and where) to seek help and Alan came highly recommended. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING CLASSES. In a word “difficult”. This isn’t an easy option: there are no short cuts… the RPS assessors will, on the surface, be kind and considerate but they will not overlook any deficiencies in your work and nor should they. Alan’s classes are an exercise in acclimatisation, he will be straight with you and, personally, I valued that above all else. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?I feel that I had the level of support that I needed. I could have had more if I had wanted it but as I already had some knowledge of the process I wasn’t starting from scratch and therefore it was more about guidance, technique improvement and a toning down of my desire to include 10 cycling related images. 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? At the time I started the course yes I did. If I am being honest I was frustrated by the failures and a bit irritated by the assessment process. Now, however, I can see how much I have improved. If at first you don’t succeed try, try and try again… I am a better photographer now than when I started this journey and arted the course yes I did. If I am being honest I was frustrated by the failures and a bit irritated by the assessment process. Now, however, I can see how much I have improved. If at first you don’t succeed try, try and try again… I am a better photographer now than when I started this journey and the day I stop trying to improve is the day I put my camera down.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?LRPS and yes :) 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I attended by Zoom which is slightly artificial but convenient. It was very clear that the print panels were far more successful as a group than the digital panels. I would say 70 - 80% of the print candidates were successful whereas there were only 3 digital candidates who succeeded. It is harder to hide deficiencies in a digital image but by the same token the standard of some of the digital panels really wasn’t great. It felt as if some of the candidates were just taking a punt on a random collection of 10 images but this is an internationally recognised achievement: no one should under estimate how seriously the assessors take their job as guardians of the keep.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I had a 1-2-1 with one of the RPS assessors prior to the final selection of my 10 panel images. There is a degree of subjectivity in all of this but with the knowledge that Alan had given me I found the 1-2-1 a useful mechanism to get inside the mindset of an assessor. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?Don’t underestimate the task ahead: it is a high bar that you are seeking to get over but if you are determined and willing to think critically about your own work and development then Alan can (and will) help you. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?For me the hardest part was recognising my own deficiencies and ignoring the well wishers who told me that nearly every image I produced was a good one. There is a world of difference between Instagram likes and being a technically proficient and critically thinking photographer. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Massively… but it doesn’t end here. I know it sounds very cheesy but I want every day to be a learning experience. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD?Alan loves images of cycling: he’s a BIG fan so I would recommend that anyone who is thinking about seeking his help to put an RPS panel together fill it with cyclists and bikes :-) ----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining an RPS distinction I can support you with my RPS Courses for distinctions RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * ZOOM - ONLINE * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

THIS GUIDE ON “HOW TO TAKE PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS” COVERS EVERYTHING FROM MASTERING LIGHTING AND COMPOSITION TO UNDERSTANDING DEPTH-OF-FIELD AND DIGITAL STYLING. SO GRAB YOUR CAMERA, AND LET'S DIVE INTO THE WORLD OF PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY!HOW TO TAKE PROFESSIONAL PHOTOShow to take professional photos----------------------------------------SECTION 1: MASTERING LIGHTING FOR PROFESSIONAL PHOTOSLighting is the cornerstone of professional photography. It can transform an ordinary photo into a visually captivating masterpiece. To capture professional photos, you must learn how to harness the magic of lighting. Here are some essential tips to help you get started:1.1 CAPTURE INTERESTING LIGHTINGThe key to creating visually striking photos is to capture lighting that is unique and captivating. Professional photographers understand the importance of finding lighting that goes beyond the ordinary. Experiment with different lighting conditions and learn how they can enhance your subject. For portraits, consider placing your subject in the s to capture lighting that is unique and captivating. Professional photographers understand the importance of finding lighting that goes beyond the ordinary. Experiment with different lighting conditions and learn how they can enhance your subject. For portraits, consider placing your subject in the shade to achieve even lighting on their face. Alternatively, try positioning them with their back to the sun to avoid harsh shadows.When it comes to landscape photography, the time of day is crucial. The golden hour, which occurs during sunrise or sunset, offers soft, warm light that can add depth and beauty to your photos. Avoid shooting landscapes in the harsh midday sun, as it often leads to unflattering and flat images.1.2 REMOVE ABERRATIONS AND DISTRACTIONSIn professional photography, removing any aberrations or distractions from your photos is essential. These can include elements that don't belong in the frame and distract the viewer from the main subject. Pay close attention to the edges of your frame to ensure no unwanted objects or clutter. Removing distractions allows your subject to take centre stage and create a more visually pleasing composition.1.3 ZOOM IN ON YOUR SUBJECT FOR CLARITYTo create a compelling composition, focusing on one clear subject is important. Avoid overcrowding your frame with multiple subjects, as this can lead to confusion and a lack of visual impact. Instead, choose one subject to be the centre of attention and zoom in tight to capture its essence. Zooming in eliminates unnecessary elements and creates a more focused and impactful photo.1.4 DIGITAL STYLING: ENHANCING COLOURS AND CONTRASTDigital styling is a powerful tool that allows photographers to enhance their photos' colours, contrast, and exposure. Like applying filters on Instagram, digital styling can add a trendy and creative touch to your images. If you're ready to delve into this aspect of photography, consider using software like Lightroom to explore various editing techniques. Learning the art of digital styling can significantly elevate your photos' overall look and feel.SECTION 2: COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES FOR PROFESSIONAL PHOTOSComposition plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and professional-looking photos. It is the art of arranging the elements within your frame to create a harmonious and engaging composition. Here are some composition techniques to help you take your photos to the next level:2.1 MASTER THE RULE OF THIRDSThe rule of thirds is a fundamental principle of composition in photography. It involves dividing your frame into a grid of nine equal parts using two vertical and two horizontal lines. The goal is to place the most important elements of your photo along these lines or at their intersections. This technique adds balance and visual interest to your composition, making it more visually appealing and professional-looking.2.2 EXPERIMENT WITH UNIQUE PERSPECTIVESDon't be afraid to experiment with unique perspectives to create truly captivating photos. Instead of shooting from eye level, try getting low to the ground or finding a higher vantage point. By changing your perspective, you can capture photos that stand out from the crowd and offer a fresh and intriguing viewpoint. Whether shooting from below to make a subject appear more powerful or capturing a bird's-eye view of a cityscape, unique perspectives can add a touch of creativity to your work.2.3 CREATE A SENSE OF DEPTHAdd apture photos that stand out from the crowd and offer a fresh and intriguing viewpoint. Whether shooting from below to make a subject appear more powerful or capturing a bird's-eye view of a cityscape, unique perspectives can add a touch of creativity to your work.2.3 CREATE A SENSE OF DEPTHAdding depth to your photos can make them appear more three-dimensional and engaging. To achieve this, incorporate elements in your composition's foreground, middle ground, and background. By including these layers, you create a sense of depth that draws the viewer into the photo. Avoid shooting portraits against flat walls or backgrounds, and instead, seek out backgrounds with depth and texture to enhance the overall visual impact.2.4 CAPTURE EMOTION AND MOODEmotion and mood are essential elements of professional photography. Instead of capturing subjects with blank expressions, strive to convey a specific mood or emotion in your photos. Whether it's joy, serenity, or intensity, the emotions you evoke can significantly enhance the impact of your photos. Pay attention to facial expressions, body language, and the overall atmosphere of your surroundings to capture the desired emotion or mood.SECTION 3: MASTERING DEPTH-OF-FIELD AND SHARPNESSUnderstanding depth-of-field and achieving sharpness in your photos are key aspects of professional photography. These techniques allow you to control what appears in focus and create visually striking images. Let's explore how you can master depth-of-field and achieve crisp sharpness in your photos:3.1 CONTROLLING DEPTH-OF-FIELDDepth-of-field refers to the area of your photo that appears in focus. It can be shallow, with only a small portion of the image in focus, or deep, with most of the scene in focus. To control depth-of-field, adjust your aperture settings. A wide aperture (low f-number, such as f/1.8) creates a shallow depth-of-field, allowing you to isolate your subject from the background. On the other hand, a narrow aperture (high f-number, such as f/16) creates a deep depth-of-field, resulting in a larger area in focus. Experiment with different aperture settings to achieve the desired effect in your photos.3.2 ACHIEVING CRISP SHARPNESSAchieving sharpness in your photos requires careful attention to focus. When photographing people, it's crucial to focus on the eyes to create a sharp and engaging image. Use autofocus or manual focus to ensure the eyes are in perfect focus. Additionally, consider using a tripod to eliminate any camera shake and achieve maximum sharpness. Experiment with different focusing techniques and practice regularly to improve your ability to capture sharp and crisp photos.SECTION 4: THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPER EXPOSUREProper exposure is vital in professional photography. It ensures that your photos are neither too bright nor too dark, resulting in a well-balanced and visually appealing image. Here are some tips for achieving proper exposure in your photos:4.1 UNDERSTAND THE EXPOSURE TRIANGLEThe exposure triangle comprises three key elements: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Understanding how these elements interact is essential for achieving proper exposure. Aperture controls the amount of light entering the camera, shutter speed determines the duration of the exposure, and ISO adjusts the camera's sensitivity to light. Experiment with different combinations of these settings to find the perfect balance for each scene and lighting condition.4.2 AV e. Aperture controls the amount of light entering the camera, shutter speed determines the duration of the exposure, and ISO adjusts the camera's sensitivity to light. Experiment with different combinations of these settings to find the perfect balance for each scene and lighting condition.4.2 AVOID OVEREXPOSURE AND UNDEREXPOSUREWhile cameras are designed to achieve a neutral exposure, it's important to remember that the neutral exposure may not always be the most visually appealing. Assess the scene and determine the key subject or element you want to highlight. Adjust your exposure settings accordingly to ensure that the subject is exposed correctly. Learn how to read the histogram for tonal range and make exposure adjustments or use bracketed exposures or filters to help obtain a good exposure.4.3 VIEWING THE PHOTO AT FULL SIZEAfter applying all the necessary techniques and adjustments to your photo, don't forget to view it at full size. Displaying your photo on a large screen or printing it in a larger format can enhance its impact and reveal intricate details that may be missed in smaller sizes. By presenting your photo at its full potential, you invite viewers to appreciate the artistry and effort behind your work.SECTION 5: THE JOURNEY OF LEARNING PHOTOGRAPHYPhotography is a journey of continuous learning and growth. To truly master the art of professional photography, consider investing in photography courses, lessons, or classes . Here are some reasons why structured learning can accelerate your progress:5.1 PERSONALISED DEVELOPMENT AND GUIDANCEPhotography courses offer personalised development and guidance tailored to your specific needs. Experienced instructors can provide valuable insights, critique your work, and offer constructive feedback to help you improve. By receiving personal i sed guidance , you can identify and address your unique areas for growth, ensuring a more efficient and effective learning experience.5.2 STRUCTURED LEARNING METHODSStructured learning methods provide a comprehensive curriculum covering all photography aspects, from technical skills to artistic expression. Courses are designed to take you on a guided journey, gradually building your knowledge and skills step by step. With a structured approach, you can avoid the pitfalls of self-teaching and gain a solid foundation in photography.5.3 UNLOCK YOUR CREATIVE POTENTIALPhotography courses and practical workshops can help you tap into your creative potential and unleash your artistic vision. By learning from experienced professionals, you'll gain insights into composition, lighting, and storytelling techniques that can elevate your photography to a new level.

UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS OF PHOTOGRAPHYBefore embarking on your photography course, it's essential to have an understanding of the basics of photography. Familiarising yourself with camera settings and equipment will provide a strong foundation for your learning journey. * MASTERING CAMERA SETTINGS One of the first steps in photography is to become familiar with the settings on your camera. While your course tutor may not have time to go through each camera individually, resources are available to help you learn. Consult your camera manual, watch tutorials on platforms like YouTube, or explore online guides to understand your camera's various buttons and features. * FAMILIARISING YOURSELF WITH THE EQUIPMENT In addition to understanding camera settings, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the external body of your camera. Take the time to explore the buttons, dials, and controls so that you can operate them efficiently during your photography course. By being comfortable with your camera equipment, you can focus more on the creative aspects of photography. * IMPORTANCE OF FULLY CHARGED BATTERIES Before each lesson, ensure that your camera's battery is fully charged. There's nothing more frustrating than arriving at a class and realising that your battery is exhausted. A fully charged battery will allow you to actively participate in exercises, change settings, and capture images throughout the session without interruptions.2. HOW TO PREPARE FOR YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY COURSES FOR BEGINNERSProper preparation is critical to getting the most out of your photography course. By following the course instructions, researching the curriculum, and dedicating time to assignments, you can set yourself up for success. * FOLLOWING COURSE INSTRUCTIONS When you receive joining instructions or directions for your photography course, read them thoroughly. These instructions will provide you with essential details such as the location, time, parking information, and any equipment you may need to bring. If you have any questions or require further clarification, don't hesitate to contact the course provider. Eliminating any unknowns will help you feel more confident and prepared on the day of the course. * RESEARCHING THE COURSE CURRICULUM To make the most of your photography course, take the time to research and understand the course curriculum. Familiarize yourself with the topics that will be covered in each class and identify any areas that align with your specific interests or objectives. Anticipate what will be taught in upcoming sessions and consider reading related materials or exploring online resources to supplement your learning. * FORMULATING QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES As you delve into the curriculum and prepare for your photography course, consider the specific questions or objectives you wish to achieve. Whether regarding subject matter, photographic style, or technical aspects, having clear questions in mind will allow you to engage more actively with the course materials and seek personalized guidance from your tutor. Write down your questions and bring them to class, ready to discuss and seek clarification. * TIME MANAGEMENT FOR ASSIGNMENTS In many photography courses, assignments reinforce learning and provide practical opportunities to apply theory ials and seek personalized guidance from your tutor. Write down your questions and bring them to class, ready to discuss and seek clarification. * TIME MANAGEMENT FOR ASSIGNMENTS In many photography courses, assignments reinforce learning and provide practical opportunities to apply theory. Dedicate sufficient time between lessons to practice your skills and complete these assignments. Treat them as valuable learning opportunities that will help you identify gaps in your understanding and receive constructive feedback from your tutor. By setting aside dedicated time for assignments, you'll make significant progress in your photographic abilities.3. ARRIVING READY FOR SUCCESSArriving at your photography course prepared and in the right mindset is crucial for a productive learning experience. Planning your travel time, arriving early, and cultivating a positive attitude ensure you're ready to make the most of each session. * PLANNING TRAVEL TIME To avoid unnecessary stress and ensure a smooth start to your photography course, plan your travel time accordingly. Aim to arrive at least 15-20 minutes early, allowing yourself ample time to find parking (if applicable), settle in, and mentally transition from your journey to the learning environment. Arriving early allows you to review class notes, familiarise yourself with the surroundings, and meet fellow attendees or even the trainer, eliminating any initial nervousness or unknowns. * ARRIVING EARLY TO SETTLE IN Arriving early not only provides a buffer for unexpected delays but also allows you to settle in and prepare yourself for the class mentally. Take advantage of this time to read any course materials, review previous lessons, or relax and clear your mind. By arriving early, you can enter the classroom with a calm and focused mindset, ready to absorb new knowledge and engage actively in learning. * CULTIVATING THE RIGHT ATTITUDE Attitude plays a significant role in the success of your photography course. It's natural to feel nervous or doubt your abilities before attending a course, but it's important to remember that everyone in the class is likely experiencing similar feelings. Embrace a positive attitude towards learning, recognizing that the course is an opportunity to expand your knowledge and skills. Avoid comparing yourself to others and focus on your personal growth and development. Believe in your potential and approach each lesson enthusiastically and open-mindedly.4. MAKING THE MOST OF CLASS TIME - PHOTOGRAPHY COURSES FOR BEGINNERSClass time is precious; maximising its value requires active participation and engagement. By reviewing previous material, assessing your understanding, and formulating questions and comments, you can make the most of each session and deepen your learning experience. * REVIEWING PREVIOUS MATERIAL Before attending each class, take the time to review the material covered in previous lessons or relevant readings. This will refresh your memory and help you connect new concepts to prior knowledge. Reviewing previous material also enables you to identify any confusion or questions that may have arisen since the last session. Going into each class with a solid understanding of previous content, you'll be better equipped to grasp new concepts and build upon your existing knowledge. * ASSESSING YOUR UNDERSTANDING As part of your preparation for each class, take a moment to assess your und since the last session. Going into each class with a solid understanding of previous content, you'll be better equipped to grasp new concepts and build upon your existing knowledge. * ASSESSING YOUR UNDERSTANDING As part of your preparation for each class, take a moment to assess your understanding of the course material. Are there concepts or techniques that you still find confusing? Are there specific areas where you feel more confident? Identify any gaps in your knowledge and bring these questions or areas of uncertainty to class. Your tutor is there to guide you and provide clarification, so don't hesitate to seek their expertise and insights. * FORMULATING QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Active class participation involves being prepared with questions or comments contributing to the discussion. Consider formulating thoughtful questions based on your interests, objectives, or areas of confusion. Engaging in meaningful dialogue with your tutor and fellow students enriches your learning experience and fosters a collaborative and supportive learning environment. By actively participating and sharing your insights, you can deepen your understanding and benefit from the perspectives of others.5. CREATING AN OPTIMAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTCreating an optimal environment that minimises distractions and fosters concentration is essential to immerse yourself in the learning process fully. By being organised and prepared, minimising distractions, and fostering a positive mindset, you can create an ideal setting for effective learning. * BEING ORGANISED AND PREPARED Being organised and prepared for your photography course sets the stage for a smooth and focused learning experience. Ensure you have all the necessary materials, such as notebooks, pens, and any required equipment, when the class begins. Arranging your materials in an orderly manner and having them readily accessible will save you time and prevent unnecessary disruptions during the session. * MINIMISING DISTRACTIONS Distractions can hinder your ability to engage and absorb the course material fully. If possible, inform colleagues or family members about your training schedule to avoid interruptions during the course. By consciously creating a distraction-free environment, you can optimise your concentration and maximise your learning time. * SWITCHING OFF DEVICES In today's digital age, it's all too easy to succumb to the temptation of checking emails, messages, or social media during breaks or lulls in the class. However, this can significantly distract you from learning and disrupt your focus. Before the class begins, switch off your electronic devices or set them to silent mode. This will allow you to fully immerse yourself in the course content and engage actively with the lessons. * FOSTERING A POSITIVE MINDSET A positive mindset is essential for effective learning and personal growth. Believe in your abilities and approach each class with enthusiasm and curiosity. Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and view any setbacks or mistakes as valuable learning experiences. By cultivating a positive mindset, you'll be more open to new ideas, receptive to feedback, and resilient in the face of obstacles. A positive attitude not only enhances your learning experience but also inspires and motivates those around you.6.

A positive attitude not only enhances your learning experience but also inspires and motivates those around you.6. EMBRACING THE LEARNING JOURNEYPhotography is a lifelong journey of growth and exploration. Embrace the process of learning and recognise that progress takes time. Rather than comparing yourself to others, focus on your individual growth and celebrate each milestone along the way. Photography courses for beginners provide you with a solid foundation, but it's important to continue learning and challenging yourself beyond the course. Embrace the joy of continuous learning and allow your passion for photography to evolve and flourish. * RECOGNISING INDIVIDUAL PROGRESS Photography courses for beginners cater to individuals at various skill levels.

Reflect on the knowledge and skills you've acquired throughout the course and acknowledge the improvements you've made in your photography. You'll feel motivated and inspired to continue honing your craft by recognising your progress. * AVOIDING COMPARISON WITH OTHERS Comparison can be detrimental to your learning journey. Every photographer has a unique style, perspective, and learning pace. Instead of comparing yourself to others, focus on your own growth and development. Embrace your individuality and use the course as an opportunity to discover and refine your own photographic voice. By embracing your unique journey and learning at your own pace, you'll find greater fulfilment and satisfaction in your photography. * EMBRACING CONTINUOUS LEARNING Photography is a dynamic field that offers endless opportunities for growth and exploration. Beyond the beginner's course, consider expanding your knowledge and skills by exploring specialised areas of photography that interest you.

      "articleBody": "EXPOSURE BRACKETING PHOTOS - DYNAMIC RANGE | A HDR GUIDEEXPOSURE BRACKETING EXPLANATIONDYNAMIC RANGE WHAT IS IT?Have you tried to take a photo of a sunset or similar \"high contrast\" situation and the result is not what you expected or wanted? Typically this high contrast light (the difference between light and dark in the picture) produces a silhouette of the objects that are in the shadows as the camera tries to expose for those lovely tones in the sky. Alternatively the camera exposes for the darker areas (shadows) and the result is the sky turns to white in your picture! Sound familiar?This happens because the range of light (known as the dynamic range) is greater than the camera is able to record in a single exposure (frame).The human eye can record approx 30 stops of dynamic range where as the camera is between 8 and 14 depending on what type you are using.Dynamic range of lightDynamic range comparison - exposure bracketingWithout getting into the science and technology of dynamic range, optimal light performance, ISO, resolution, detail and other factors that contribute to the quality and intensity of light being recorded on the sensor, when we are faced with a high dynamic range scene we have choices and decisions to make.CHOICES TO CAPTURE HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE IMAGES 1. The most obvious option but often ignored - change your composition so that you reduce the amount of bright and dark areas in the frame. Maybe you don't need so much of re faced with a high dynamic range scene we have choices and decisions to make.CHOICES TO CAPTURE HIGH DYNAMIC RANGE IMAGES 1. The most obvious option but often ignored - change your composition so that you reduce the amount of bright and dark areas in the frame. Maybe you don't need so much of the foreground/landscape if taking a photo of the sky and its rich and intense colours and light. 2. Use graduated neutral density filters to reduce the density of the bright areas of the image - typically the sky or reflected light on wet surfaces or water. This will reduce the dynamic range of light and hopefully enable you take the image with a single exposure. 3. Even if you do both of the above, you may still have a scene with a dynamic range greater than the camera can record. When faced with this situation then you will need to take more than one exposure of the scene. Taking multiple exposures of the same scene is called bracketing exposures. The amount of exposures required will depend on the dynamic range you need to record to capture details in the shadows and highlights.Most camera's come equipped with AEB (automatic exposure bracketing) which allow the user to set the qty of exposures required and the number of stops of exposure between each frame. Some camera's also come equipped with the ability to not only take a number of exposures but also to merge them together in camera for you. The iPhone also has this but is restricted to two frames only. This is known as HDR - High Dynamic Range.To get the best results from bracketed exposures you will need learn how to blend the frames together in software afterwards. TIPS TO EXPOSURE BRACKETING * Use a tripod so that there is no change in camera position between frames * Use a remote release cable to avoid camera shake between frames * Check your first and last exposure to make sure you have data in the shadows and highlightsBRACKETED FRAMES3 bracketed exposures with histogram to show 2 stops either side of the metered exposureMERGING THE EXPOSURE BRACKETED FRAMESThere are several methods for combining the bracketed frames on the computer. Everyone has their favourites and it's largely subjective because depends on your taste or lack of it!My tip for merging your frames is to not try and do the editing/processing as part of the merging process. Treat the merging of the frames as simply that - the process to give you a good digital negative to work on separately - treat this as stage 1 to get a good single combined image without thinking about sharpening, colour, contrast and so on.View fullsizeTop image the blended exposures - without any additional processing (exposure fusion)Bottom image the processed image using Adobe LightroomIf you want to learn more about dynamic range, bracketing using filters and the software and techniques to process images then join me on:Bracketing & Filters Master Class Lightroom Course for Beginners If you want to buy filters then I recommend Linhoff Studios who will give you a 10% discount off the RRP if you tell them you are a customer of Alan Ranger Photography.

If so, a travel tripod is an essential accessory to add to your photography gear. The perfect travel tripod provides stability and versatility, allowing you to take sharp, professional-looking photos in various lighting conditions and challenging environments. This comprehensive guide will explore the key features, benefits, and considerations to help you choose the perfect travel tripod for your needs.Following a recent residential workshop in the Lake District with a lovely group of clients, plenty of discussions and opinions were shared about tripods, their use, need, cost, weight, and matching individual needs to the right tripod. One particular client, not normally a landscaper photographer, has particular needs to suit them. Mainly travel photography, often in urban areas rather than rugged landscape terrains and essentially for them small, lightweight and it had to have flip lock rather than twist locks. They wanted the perfect travel tripod so having been and advocate of the Benro Rhino series for most of my clients and also the combination of the Benro GD3WH geared head on the C3770TN tripod legs - I accepted the challenge to find an alternative for them.After a bit of research and wi tography/recommended-travel-lightweight-tripods] for most of my clients and also the combination of the Benro GD3WH geared head on the C3770TN tripod legs - I accepted the challenge to find an alternative for them.After a bit of research and with the kind support of Benro UK, I received the new Benro Cyanbird to put to the test in the field, and the following weekend, I was able to provide a client with its use for the weekend to put it through its paces in Snowdonia.Their verdict after two days of extensive use was;> “it’s great that it’s lightweight and makes carrying it when walking up ascents etc, much more manageable. Generally speaking, it's perfect, but the legs are a little flimsy and had to use the centre column to get the height needed to avoid crouching, making the whole set-up a little more unstable and susceptible to camera shake in the wind. I also found that the base plate reguarly slipped in vertical camera position mode despite tightening as much as i could by hand.”My own view of watching someone use it was not dissimilar to theirs but would add that I needed to intervene a few times to make sure everything was tightened up securely - maybe being brand new out of the box it wasn’t quite tightened on all the connection points. It was fine once the head was secured tightly and base plate onto camera tightly but i’d suggest that a larger camera and lens may find its just a touch to lightweight for their set-up. The official max weight load is 4kg and that’s probably fine in horizontal axis but with a max height of 155cm and vertical framing part and parcel of landscape photography you may find this just a little short and difficult to support a heavier camera body and lens.----------------------------------------WHY YOU NEED A TRAVEL TRIPODCapturing beautiful images requires stability, especially when shooting in low light or using long exposure techniques. A travel tripod provides a sturdy base for your camera, minimizing camera shake and enabling you to take sharp, blur-free photos. Whether you're shooting landscapes, architecture, or portraits, a travel tripod is a valuable tool that allows you to unleash your creativity and capture stunning images.KEY FEATURES TO CONSIDER FOR THE PERFECT TRAVEL TRIPODWhen choosing a travel tripod, several key features should be taken into consideration. Let's explore these features and understand their importance:1. PORTABILITYPortability is a crucial factor when selecting a travel tripod. As a travel photographer, you need a tripod that is lightweight and compact, making it easy to carry in your backpack or camera bag. Look for tripods that fold down to a small size without compromising on stability or functionality.2. HEIGHT AND STABILITYConsider the maximum height of the travel tripod to ensure it meets your shooting requirements. A taller tripod allows you to shoot from different angles and perspectives. Additionally, stability is essential to prevent your tripod from wobbling or tipping over. Look for tripods with robust construction and reliable locking mechanisms to ensure stability in various shooting conditions.3. MATERIAL AND BUILD QUALITYA travel tripod's material and build quality determine its durability and weight. Carbon fibre tripods are lightweight and sturdy, making them an excellent choice for travel photographers. Aluminium tripods are also durable but may be slightly heavier. g conditions.3. MATERIAL AND BUILD QUALITYA travel tripod's material and build quality determine its durability and weight. Carbon fibre tripods are lightweight and sturdy, making them an excellent choice for travel photographers. Aluminium tripods are also durable but may be slightly heavier. Consider your needs and preferences when choosing between these materials.4. LEG LOCKING MECHANISMThe leg locking mechanism plays a vital role in a travel tripod's ease of use and stability. Flip locks and twist locks are the two most common types. Flip locks are quick and easy to operate, while twist locks offer a more secure and compact design. Choose a leg-locking mechanism that suits your shooting style and preferences.5. HEAD TYPEThe tripod head is responsible for holding and adjusting your camera. There are different types of tripod heads, including ball heads, pan heads, geared heads and gimbal heads. Ball heads provide flexibility and ease of use, allowing you to adjust the camera position quickly. Pan and geared heads offer more precise control over horizontal and vertical movements. Consider your shooting style and preferences when selecting the tripod head type.----------------------------------------THE BENRO CYANBIRD PERFECT TRAVEL TRIPOD: A CLOSER LOOKNow that we have explored the key features to consider when choosing a travel tripod, let's take a closer look at the Benro Cyanbird Travel Tripod.

Unfortunately, both evenings were not blessed with any sort of sunset sky, and as we entered the dusk period, most clouds vanished altogether or were not over or anywhere near the castle ruins. However, there was still an opportunity to discuss techniques and one in particular that clients said they hadn't come across before which is how to take long exposures without the use of ND filters to extend exposure time and/or deal with little visible movement in the clouds. This technique that I am about to explain can also work on other subjects, not just cloudy skies so I hope you can put it into practice on your next shoot.TECHNIQUEThe technique is time-lapse photography. Meaning, you will take a series of shots at intervals, with or without ND filters so that the multiple frames capture subtle shi ain can also work on other subjects, not just cloudy skies so I hope you can put it into practice on your next shoot.TECHNIQUEThe technique is time-lapse photography. Meaning, you will take a series of shots at intervals, with or without ND filters so that the multiple frames capture subtle shifts in movement from your subject. Combining them into a single exposure is the function of software, in the examples below and steps I have used Adobe Photoshop but there are alternative software products on the market to do the same thing, and many are free to use or donation based.The advantage of this method is that you can optimise your aperture, ISO and exposure time to reduce the effects of sensor noise from extreme long exposures made with 10 and 15 stop ND filters when exposure times run into minutes rather than seconds.----------------------------------------METHOD - 10 STEPS TO CREATE A LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY, TIME-LAPSE IMAGEYou need a scene where there is some sort of movement, clouds, water, people, vehicles whatever your subject matter is.You will need; * a tripod * a remote release to control to trigger the exposures 1. Place the camera on the tripod and follow the same \"rules\" for the composition of your image and test shots as you would normally do. I.e. Take your shot and inspect it for sharpness, DoF, exposure and framing adjustments. 2. Having checked everything you can shoot a series of shots which show the movement of your element. You may need at least 10-30 images taken 30 secs or longer apart, depending on the speed of movement. (optimise your ISO/Aperture combo to reduce noise) 3. If you have a remote release with a lock option, you can switch your drive mode from single shot to continuous and lock the remote release, so it automatically takes a shot one after the other at the exposure time intervals set by the meter. My camera does adjust exposure time between frames to take into account changes in light throughout the process. 4. You can use this method with or without ND filters in Aperture priority for exposure times up to 30 seconds. See my examples below 5. When home, go to Adobe Lightroom. Import the images into the catalogue, work your basic edits on the first shot (crop/framing adjustments, dust spot removal and anything critical.) Then synchronise all the edits of this shot with the others of the series. 6. Then select all the images in the series, right-click, and open in Photoshop as layers. This process may take some time depending on the size of files (RAW or JPG) and the processor and memory of your computer. So be patient. When finished, you will have a Photoshop document with all the images in a stack of layers. 7. The next step is to select all the layers and then right-click \"Convert to a smart object\". This is a single layer object that contains the information of all the previous layers. 8. When finished, go to the menu at the top and select Layers -> Smart Object -> Stack Mode -> Mean. It will take a little time to combine the layers and movement, but you will end up with a combined image simulating your long exposure. 9. Finally, flatten the smart object because Photoshop has a limit on the size of the image of 4GB so you won't be able to save back to Lightroom if you have used multiple frames in RAW format - Check document size bottom left of Photoshop for file size. 10. Now work on the combined time-lapse, long exposure image as you would typica because Photoshop has a limit on the size of the image of 4GB so you won't be able to save back to Lightroom if you have used multiple frames in RAW format - Check document size bottom left of Photoshop for file size. 10. Now work on the combined time-lapse, long exposure image as you would typically do for stylising the result.----------------------------------------MY EXAMPLES - LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHYThe first thing to say is the final images are not ones that I am happy with or think are noteworthy; they were taken to try and demonstrate the technique more than for their aesthetic beauty. The trouble with locations like these is that they are swamped by tourists, being generally ignorant, walking through the crops taking selfies and acting like selfish idiots. It’s one of the reasons I have dropped lavender field workshops from my schedule in the last two years. Yesterday was no exception and trying to time exposures without someone, or a group of narcissistic, self-indulgent day-trippers was a challenge, and the light was not great either, let alone the quality of the fields themselves. However, I think the images still give you an idea of effects you can get in the clouds at least even when there is no visible movement to the eye.----------------------------------------EXAMPLE 1 - LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY * Using a 10 stop ND filter * ISO 50, F16, 13 secs x 50 frames in RAW (15 min of time-lapse) - the resulting combined image in PS was 10GB * Observation - many frames, 50 in this example, you lose any real definition in the moving parts and it becomes blurred rather than showing any details. However, it does allow the static subject (lavender field) to take central focus and stage.View fullsize12 min time-lapse long exposure combined image----------------------------------------EXAMPLE 2 - LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY * Using a 6 stop ND filter * ISO 50, F16, 20 secs x 10 frames in RAW (2.5 mins apart over) 25 mins of time-lapse * Observation - fewer exposures (10 frames) but spaced apart keeps more definition and detailsView fullsize25 min time-lapse long exposure combined image----------------------------------------EXAMPLE 3 - LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY * Using a 10 stop ND filter * ISO 50, F16, 25 secs x 8 frames in RAW (1.5 mins apart over) 12 min of time-lapse * Observation - fewer exposures (8 frames) but spaced apart creates a dramatic resultView fullsize12 min time-lapse long exposure combined image----------------------------------------EXAMPLE 4 LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY * Using a 6 stop ND filter * ISO 50, F16, 6 secs x 4 frames in RAW (2 mins apart over) 8 min of time-lapse * Observation - fewer exposures (4 frames) but spaced longer apart shows subtle shifts in movementView fullsize8 min time-lapse long exposure combined image----------------------------------------CONCLUSION - LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHYThere are no rights or wrongs when it comes to which effect you prefer from the examples; they all have their merits depending on your personal viewpoint and taste. I’d be interested to know what my community think works best, so please add your comments to this post.Personally, I can see merit any of the above examples of different amounts of motion blur. Therefore I challenge you to learn how to experiment and create the impact you prefer for long exposures. Yes, of course, you have to execute technically with exposure, focus, DoF, comp comments to this post.Personally, I can see merit any of the above examples of different amounts of motion blur.

Adobe Lightroom, a popular software among professionals and enthusiasts alike, has recently released its latest version, Lightroom Classic 13. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the exciting new features and enhancements that this update brings, empowering photographers to take their craft to new heights. So, without further ado, let's dive into what's new in Lightroom!WHAT’S NEW IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC -HDR DISPLAY AND EDITING: UNLEASH THE POWER OF DYNAMIC RANGEOne of the standout features of Lightroom Classic 13 is its support for HDR display and editing. HDR, or High Dynamic Range, allows photographers to capture and display a wider range of tones, resulting in more vibrant and lifelike images. With Lightroom's HDR capabilities, you can now work in an HDR colour space and view your images on HDR-supported displays, ensuring accurate and stunning visual representation.Import your RAW files or merge HDR images to activate HDR mode in Lightroom. You'll immediately notice the expanded range and enhanced details in your photos. Moreover, you can export your edited images in HDR-compatible formats, although HDR HEIF images are currently unsupported. This feature is particularly beneficial for photographers working with newer cameras that ca m. You'll immediately notice the expanded range and enhanced details in your photos. Moreover, you can export your edited images in HDR-compatible formats, although HDR HEIF images are currently unsupported. This feature is particularly beneficial for photographers working with newer cameras that capture images in HDR-compatible formats, as it allows for precise editing and faithful representation on HDR displays.WHAT’S NEW IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC - AI-BASED DEPTH BLUR: UNLEASH YOUR CREATIVITYLightroom Classic 13 introduces an exciting AI-based depth blur feature that allows photographers to create realistic depth-of-field effects. With this tool, you can generate an artificial depth map for your image and apply blur based on that map. The result? Stunning images with a professional-looking bokeh effect.The AI-based depth blur feature in Lightroom Classic 13 offers a range of options and controls to achieve the desired effect. You can visualize the depth map and adjust the area of focus using a slider. Additionally, you can refine the depth map by brushing in or out areas of focus. This feature is not limited to images captured with depth information; it can also be applied to photos from devices like iPhones that embed depth maps. With AI-powered depth blur, the possibilities for creative expression are endless.WHAT’S NEW IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC - POINT COLOUR: FINE-TUNE YOUR COLORS WITH PRECISIONPhotographers who seek precise control over their colours will appreciate the addition of the Point Colour feature in Lightroom Classic 13. This new tab in the Color Mixer panel allows you to edit individual colours with unparalleled accuracy. Unlike the traditional colour mixer, which offers a fixed set of colours, Point Colour enables you to select specific colours directly from your image for targeted adjustments.Using the eyedropper colour picker, you can sample colours from your image and create a range of controls for precise editing. The large palette visually represents the selected colour, and you can adjust its destination colour for remapping. Sliders are available to fine-tune the selected colour's hue, saturation, and luminance. Additionally, a range slider allows you to define how much the selected colour range is affected. With Point Colour, you can achieve professional-grade colour adjustments without leaving the Lightroom environment.WHAT’S NEW IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC - ENHANCED PERFORMANCE: A SEAMLESS EDITING EXPERIENCEIn addition to these major feature updates, Lightroom Classic 13 also brings several performance improvements to enhance your editing workflow. Adobe has worked tirelessly to address bugs, optimize metadata operations, and improve the stability and speed of various tasks. Let's take a closer look at some of these performance enhancements: * Faster image conversion to DNG: Converting your images to the Digital Negative (DNG) format is now quicker and more efficient, allowing you to streamline your workflow. * Improved metadata operations: Reading, writing, and managing metadata in Lightroom Classic 13 is now faster and smoother, ensuring a seamless experience when working with large catalogues. * Enhanced XMP writing and reading: Lightroom Classic 13 offers improved performance when reading and writing XMP metadata, enabling faster synchronization and management of your image information. * Stability and performance improvements: Folder move and delete operations, as well as image loading in th ced XMP writing and reading: Lightroom Classic 13 offers improved performance when reading and writing XMP metadata, enabling faster synchronization and management of your image information. * Stability and performance improvements: Folder move and delete operations, as well as image loading in the Develop loupe view, have been optimized for increased stability and responsiveness.These performance enhancements contribute to an overall improved editing experience, allowing you to focus on your creative process without being hindered by technical limitations.WHAT’S NEW IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC - EXPANDED CAMERA AND LENS SUPPORT: STAY UP-TO-DATELightroom Classic 13 continues to expand its support for the latest cameras and lenses, ensuring that photographers have access to the most up-to-date profiles.

Lightroom Classic 13 empowers me to tell that story with stunning visuals.\" - Anonymous.----------------------------------------Credit to Jeff Hirsch Photography for producing a detailed, but no waffle explanation of all the new enhancements of What’s New In Lightroom Classic. I’ve watched several, but this was the best one for an overview. He didn’t cover the new file formats of Jpeg XL, and I think many are currently looking at the new format and weighing up the gains of smaller file sizes versus any loss of quality - so the jury is still out on whether this is a better format.----------------------------------------What’s New In Lightroom Classiclightroom , photography-basics , photography-courses , photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 12 October 2023Alan Ranger Photography lightroom , editing-photos , news LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 &url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alanranger.com%2Fblog-on-photography%2Fwhats-new-in-lightroom-classic-13]",

So, is social media good for photographers? The answer is yes but equally with some caveats.Social media platforms provide photographers with a powerful tool to showcase their work to a wide audience. Through platforms such as Instagram and Facebook, photographers can easily share their photographs with millions of people around the world. This exposure can lead to new clients, collaborations, and even opportunities to have their work featured in magazines or art exhibitions. Additionally, social media allows photographers to connect with other professionals in the industry, enabling them to learn from each other and stay updated on the latest trends and techniques.Furthermore, social media offers photographers a platform for self-promotion and branding. By curating their online presence and sharing their work consistently, photographers can develop a strong personal brand that sets them apart from their competitors. They can also engage with their audience directly by responding to comments and messages, fostering a sense of connection and loyalty among their followers. The interactive nature of social media allows photographers to receive feedback on their work and gain valuable insights into eir competitors. They can also engage with their audience directly by responding to comments and messages, fostering a sense of connection and loyalty among their followers. The interactive nature of social media allows photographers to receive feedback on their work and gain valuable insights into what resonates with their audience.This real-time feedback can help photographers refine their skills and improve their craft. However, it is important for photographers to use social media strategically and not solely rely on it as their primary marketing tool. While social media provides numerous benefits for photographers, it can also be overwhelming and time-consuming if not managed properly. It is crucial for photographers to strike a balance between creating content, engaging with their audience, and focusing on their actual photography work.In this post, I list some of the pros and cons of using social media for photographers and eight tips to get the most from your social media.is social media good for photographersTHE ADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS 1. INCREASED VISIBILITY AND EXPOSURE ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OF USING SOCIAL MEDIA AS A PHOTOGRAPHER IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED VISIBILITY AND EXPOSURE. BY SHARING YOUR WORK ON PLATFORMS LIKE INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK, AND BEHANCE, YOU CAN REACH A GLOBAL AUDIENCE AND GAIN RECOGNITION FOR YOUR TALENT. SOCIAL MEDIA ALLOWS YOU TO CURATE YOUR OWN ONLINE GALLERY, SHOWCASING YOUR BEST WORK AND ATTRACTING POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND COLLABORATORS. 2. NETWORKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDES PHOTOGRAPHERS WITH A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITH LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS AND BUILD A SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY. JOINING PHOTOGRAPHY GROUPS, PARTICIPATING IN DISCUSSIONS, AND ENGAGING WITH OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS CAN NOT ONLY EXPAND YOUR NETWORK BUT ALSO OFFER VALUABLE INSIGHTS, FEEDBACK, AND INSPIRATION. COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS CAN ARISE FROM THESE CONNECTIONS, OPENING DOORS TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECTS. 3. MARKETING AND PROMOTION USING SOCIAL MEDIA AS A MARKETING TOOL CAN SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT PHOTOGRAPHERS. PLATFORMS LIKE INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK OFFER VARIOUS FEATURES THAT ALLOW YOU TO PROMOTE YOUR WORK, SUCH AS STORIES, REELS, AND PAID ADVERTISEMENTS. BY STRATEGICALLY USING HASHTAGS, TAGGING RELEVANT BRANDS OR INDIVIDUALS, AND SHARING BEHIND-THE-SCENES CONTENT, YOU CAN ATTRACT ATTENTION AND GENERATE INTEREST IN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY. 4. FEEDBACK AND IMPROVEMENT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PROVIDE PHOTOGRAPHERS INSTANT FEEDBACK AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND IMPROVEMENT. THROUGH LIKES, COMMENTS, AND DIRECT MESSAGES, YOU CAN GAUGE THE RECEPTION OF YOUR WORK, LEARN FROM YOUR AUDIENCE, AND REFINE YOUR SKILLS. ENGAGING WITH YOUR FOLLOWERS AND ACTIVELY SEEKING CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM CAN HELP YOU EVOLVE AS A PHOTOGRAPHER AND DEVELOP YOUR UNIQUE STYLE. 5. INSPIRATION AND EDUCATION SOCIAL MEDIA IS A TREASURE TROVE OF INSPIRATION AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS. BY FOLLOWING OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS, INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS, AND PHOTOGRAPHY ACCOUNTS, YOU CAN STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LATEST TRENDS, TECHNIQUES, AND CREATIVE IDEAS. MANY PHOTOGRAPHERS SHARE TUTORIALS, BEHIND-THE-SCENES VIDEOS, AND TIPS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, PROVIDING A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND INSPIRATION FOR ASPIRING PHOTOGRAPHERS.THE DISADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS 1. COPYRIGHT AND UNAUTHORISED US LATEST TRENDS, TECHNIQUES, AND CREATIVE IDEAS. MANY PHOTOGRAPHERS SHARE TUTORIALS, BEHIND-THE-SCENES VIDEOS, AND TIPS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, PROVIDING A WEALTH OF KNOWLEDGE AND INSPIRATION FOR ASPIRING PHOTOGRAPHERS.THE DISADVANTAGES OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS 1. COPYRIGHT AND UNAUTHORISED USE ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IS THE RISK OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND UNAUTHORISED USE OF THEIR WORK. WHILE WATERMARKING AND COPYRIGHT DECLARATIONS CAN OFFER SOME PROTECTION, IT'S CHALLENGING TO CONTROL THE SPREAD AND USAGE OF YOUR IMAGES ONCE THEY'RE SHARED ONLINE. IT'S ESSENTIAL TO BE VIGILANT AND TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 2. PRESSURE AND COMPARISON SOCIAL MEDIA CAN CREATE A SENSE OF PRESSURE AND COMPARISON AMONG PHOTOGRAPHERS. THE QUEST FOR LIKES, FOLLOWERS, AND RECOGNITION CAN SOMETIMES OVERSHADOW THE TRUE ESSENCE OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND LEAD TO A FOCUS ON POPULARITY RATHER THAN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT SOCIAL MEDIA METRICS ARE NOT THE SOLE MEASURE OF SUCCESS AND TO STAY TRUE TO YOUR OWN VISION AND CREATIVE VOICE. 3. TIME CONSUMPTION AND DISTRACTION MANAGING MULTIPLE SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS AND CONSISTENTLY POSTING CONTENT CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND DISTRACTING. IT'S EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE ENDLESS SCROLL AND ENGAGEMENT METRICS, TAKING AWAY VALUABLE TIME FROM ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND CREATIVE PURSUITS. SETTING BOUNDARIES, SCHEDULING SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVITIES, AND PRIORITIZING REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCES CAN HELP MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BALANCE. 4. ALGORITHMIC CHALLENGES SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OFTEN RELY ON COMPLEX ALGORITHMS THAT DETERMINE THE VISIBILITY AND REACH OF YOUR CONTENT. CHANGES IN ALGORITHMS CAN IMPACT THE ORGANIC REACH OF YOUR POSTS, MAKING IT HARDER TO GAIN EXPOSURE AND ENGAGEMENT. ADAPTING TO THESE ALGORITHMIC CHALLENGES AND STAYING UPDATED ON PLATFORM CHANGES CAN BE A CONSTANT BATTLE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS. 5. LACK OF CONTROL AND AUTHENTICITY SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PROVIDE LIMITED CONTROL OVER HOW YOUR IMAGES ARE PRESENTED AND PERCEIVED. THE FAST-PACED NATURE OF SOCIAL MEDIA CAN SOMETIMES UNDERMINE THE VALUE AND AUTHENTICITY OF YOUR WORK, REDUCING IT TO MERE SCROLLING CONTENT. IT'S CRUCIAL TO MAINTAIN YOUR ARTISTIC INTEGRITY AND CURATE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PRESENCE IN A WAY THAT ALIGNS WITH YOUR UNIQUE STYLE AND VISION.TIPS FOR MAKING THE MOST OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS 1. BE SELECTIVE: Rather than posting every photo you've taken, curate your best work and focus on quality over quantity. Showcase your unique style and vision to attract a dedicated audience. 2. ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY: Actively engage with other photographers, industry professionals, and followers. Participate in discussions, offer feedback, and build genuine connections within the photography community. 3. PROTECT YOUR WORK: Take necessary measures to protect your intellectual property. Watermark your images, include copyright declarations, and consider using platforms like Pixsy to monitor and enforce your copyright. 4. STAY AUTHENTIC: Maintain your artistic integrity and stay true to your unique style. Avoid succumbing to trends or compromising your vision for the sake of popularity. Authenticity will attract a dedicated audience that appreciates your work. 5. USE ANALYTICS: To Your Advantage: Utilise the analytics provided by soc artistic integrity and stay true to your unique style.

WHETHER YOU'RE A PROFESSIONAL OR AN AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER, HAVING THE RIGHT FILTERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY. ONE BRAND THAT HAS GAINED RECOGNITION FOR ITS INNOVATIVE FILTER SYSTEMS IS KASE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE WILL EXPLORE THE ADVANTAGES AND FEATURES OF “REVOLUTION “ KASE FILTERS, INCLUDING THEIR INLAID RING DESIGN, COMPATIBILITY, AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE. LET'S DIVE IN AND DISCOVER HOW THESE FILTERS CAN REVOLUTIONIZE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE.UNDERSTANDING PHOTOGRAPHIC FILTERSBefore delving into the specifics of Kase Revolution filters, let's briefly discuss the importance of photographic filters. Filters are transparent accessories that are attached to the front of a camera lens to modify or control the light entering the camera. They can enhance colors, reduce glare, and adjust exposure levels, resulting in more vibrant and visually appealing images. Two popular types of filters are Neutral Density (ND) filters and Polarizers.NEUTRAL DENSITY (ND) FILTERSNeutral Density filters are designed to reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing for longer exposure times without overexposing the image. They are invaluable for landscape photographers who want to capture smooth, flowing waterfalls or create motion blur in their images. D) FILTERSNeutral Density filters are designed to reduce the amount of light entering the camera, allowing for longer exposure times without overexposing the image. They are invaluable for landscape photographers who want to capture smooth, flowing waterfalls or create motion blur in their images. ND filters come in various strengths, indicated by the number of stops they reduce the light, such as ND8 (3 stops) or ND64 (6 stops).View fullsizePOLARIZERSPolarizing filters help eliminate reflections and glare from non-metallic surfaces, such as water, wet surfaces or glass. They can deepen the blue sky, make clouds more prominent, and enhance colour saturation. Polarizers are particularly useful in landscape and outdoor photography, where they can significantly improve the overall image quality and exposure. For woodland photography, they are a must for me, helping to remove reflective highlights from all those random leaf surfaces.View fullsize----------------------------------------INTRODUCING KASE REVOLUTION FILTERSKase Filters have gained attention in the photography community for their unique design and outstanding performance. These filters offer several key features that differentiate them from conventional filter systems. Let's take a closer look at what makes Kase Revolution Filters stand out.INLAID RING DESIGNOne of the most notable features of Kase Filters is their inlaid ring design. Unlike conventional filters that fit on top of the lens ring, the inlaid ring sits inside the lens's filter thread. This design allows the filters to sit closer to the lens's front element, reducing the chances of vignetting and ensuring optimal image quality.View fullsizeCOMPATIBILITY AND SIZE OPTIONSKase Filters come in three thread sizes: 77mm, 82mm, and 95mm, making them compatible with a wide range of lenses. The filters are available in both Entry-Level Kits and Pro Kits, catering to photographers with varying needs. The Entry-Level Kits include essential filters such as polarizers and ND filters (ND8 and ND64), while the Pro Kits add an ND1000 filter (10 stops) for more advanced long-exposure photography.COLOUR-CODED FILTER RIMSKase Revolution Filters feature colour-coded filter rims to make it easier for photographers to distinguish between different filters. The polarizer has a silver rim, the ND8 has a blue rim, the ND64 has a gold rim, and the ND1000 (exclusive to the Pro Kits) has a red rim. This colour-coding system lets photographers quickly identify the desired filter, saving time and ensuring a smooth workflow.View fullsizeCONVENIENT ACCESSORIESKase Revolution Filters come with several convenient accessories that enhance the overall user experience. The filters include magnetic lens caps, which provide a secure and hassle-free way to protect the filters when not in use. Additionally, the filters, adapter rings, and lens cap can be neatly stored and carried in the provided grey fabric carry case, which features a belt loop and brass clip for easy transport.View fullsizeADVANTAGES OF KASE REVOLUTION FILTERSNow that we have explored the key features of Kase Revolution Filters, let's discuss their advantages over conventional filter systems.CLOSER FILTER PLACEMENT AND REDUCED VIGNETTINGThe inlaid ring design of Kase Revolution Filters allows the filters to sit closer to the lens's front element. This closer placement minimizes the chances of vignetting, especially with lenses cuss their advantages over conventional filter systems.CLOSER FILTER PLACEMENT AND REDUCED VIGNETTINGThe inlaid ring design of Kase Revolution Filters allows the filters to sit closer to the lens's front element. This closer placement minimizes the chances of vignetting, especially with lenses that require slim filters. By reducing vignetting, photographers can capture images with maximum clarity and avoid unwanted dark corners or edges in their shots.SEAMLESS STACKING OF FILTERSKase Revolution Filters make it easy to stack multiple filters, allowing photographers to combine different effects and achieve their desired creative vision. With the magnetic attachment system, photographers can stack polarizers and ND filters without any hassle, enabling them to control light and exposure precisely.HIGH-QUALITY OPTICS AND IMAGE PERFORMANCEOne crucial aspect of any filter system is its impact on image quality. Kase Revolution Filters excel in this regard, providing exceptional optical quality and ensuring minimal distortion or color shifts. These filters are designed to deliver accurate and true-to-life colours, allowing photographers to capture images with stunning clarity and detail.USER-FRIENDLY DESIGN AND EASY INSTALLATIONInstalling and removing filters should be seamless, and Kase Revolution Filters deliver on this front. The magnetic attachment system allows for quick and secure filter attachment, saving photographers valuable time in the field. However, it's worth noting that removing filters with a lens hood in place can be challenging, as the magnets are strong and the filters are thin. It is recommended to remove the lens hood before taking off the filters or to use the filters without a lens hood if possible.View fullsizeKase FiltersOVERCOMING LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTWhile Kase Revolution Filters offer numerous advantages, there are a few limitations and areas for improvement worth mentioning.NO GRADUATED NEUTRAL DENSITY (GND) FILTERSOne limitation of Kase Revolution Filters is the absence of graduated neutral density (GND) filters. GND filters are traditionally used to balance exposure between the sky and the foreground in landscape photography. As Kase Revolution Filters have a circular design, it is not possible to create GND filters for this system. Photographers who heavily rely on GND filters may find this limitation to be a drawback and may need to explore alternative filter solutions. Or do as I do and bracket exposures.CHALLENGES WITH LENS CAPS AND FILTER REMOVALThe magnetic lens caps provided with Kase Revolution Filters offer a sleek and compact alternative to standard lens caps. However, removing the lens cap can be challenging, especially when a lens hood is in place. It would be beneficial if the lens caps had a small handle or clasp in the middle, allowing for easier removal without the need to take off the lens hood. Additionally, photographers wearing thick winter gloves might find it challenging to remove the filters due to the strong magnets and thin design.CONCLUSIONPhotographic filters play a vital role in enhancing the creative possibilities of photography. Kase Revolution Filters offer a unique and innovative solution for photographers looking to elevate their images. With their inlaid ring design, compatibility, and overall performance, these filters provide photographers with the tools they need to capture stunning and visually captivating sh raphy.

THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCATION: FINDING THE PERFECT SPOT Choosing the right location is crucial in landscape photography. It sets the stage for your composition and determines the mood and atmosphere of your photographs. Whether you prefer the rugged beauty of mountains, the tranquility of lakes, or the enchantment of forests, there are endless possibilities to explore. Researching potential locations, visiting them at different times of the day, and understanding their unique features will help you create compelling and captivating images. 2. HARNESSING THE POWER OF LIGHT: GOLDEN HOUR AND BLUE HOUR Light is the soul of photography, and landscape photography can transform an ordinary scene into something extraordinary. The golden hour, which occurs during the first hour after sunrise and the last hour before sunset, bathes the landscape in a warm, soft light that adds a touch of magic to your photographs. The long shadows, golden tones, and gentle glow create a captivating atmosphere that brings out the textures and colours of the landscape. Similarly, the blue hour, which happens before sunrise and after sunset, offers a serene, ethereal light that casts a beautiful blue hue and adds a sense of tranquillity to your images. Embrace these magical hours to capture the true essence of the landscape. 3. UNDERSTANDING COMPOSITION: CREATING A VISUAL STORY Composition is the backbone of any great photograph, and landscape photography is no exception. It is the art of arranging the elements within your frame to create a visually pleasing and balanced image. By following the rule of thirds, leading lines, and incorporating foreground interest, you can guide the viewer's eye through the photograph and create a sense of depth and dimension. Experiment with different compositions and perspectives to find the one that best conveys your vision and tells a captivating visual story. 4. CAPTURING DYNAMIC SKIES The sky is often a captivating element in landscape photography, adding drama and depth to your images. Pay attention to the weather conditions and look for opportunities to capture dynamic skies filled with clouds, vibrant sunsets, or dramatic storm formations. Use graduated neutral density filters to balance the exposure between the sky and the landscape, ensuring a well-exposed image. 5. EXPLORING UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES To create truly memorable landscape photographs, challenge yourself to find unique perspectives and viewpoints. Instead of settling for the typical tourist shots, venture off the beaten path and discover hidden gems that offer fresh and unexpected angles. Climb hills, explore valleys, or wade through streams to capture the landscape from a new and exciting vantage point. 6. HARNESSING THE POWER OF FOREGROUND INTEREST Foreground interest adds de venture off the beaten path and discover hidden gems that offer fresh and unexpected angles. Climb hills, explore valleys, or wade through streams to capture the landscape from a new and exciting vantage point. 6. HARNESSING THE POWER OF FOREGROUND INTEREST Foreground interest adds depth and visual impact to your landscape images, drawing the viewer's attention into the scene. Look for interesting elements such as rocks, flowers, or leading lines that can serve as a compelling foreground. Experiment with different aperture settings to achieve the desired depth of field, ensuring that both the foreground and the background are in sharp focus. 7. WORKING WITH FILTERS: ENHANCING THE LANDSCAPE Filters are valuable tools in landscape photography, allowing you to control and manipulate the light entering your camera. A polarizing filter, for example, can reduce glare and enhance colours, particularly in skies and bodies of water. Neutral density filters help you achieve longer exposure times, creating a sense of movement in elements such as flowing water or clouds. Graduated neutral density filters can balance the exposure between the sky and the foreground, ensuring that both areas are correctly exposed, you can also use exposure bracketing AEB. Experimenting with different filters will expand your creative possibilities and enable you to capture the landscape uniquely and captivatingly. 8. MASTERING DEPTH OF FIELD: CREATING DIMENSION Depth of field is a powerful tool in landscape photography, enabling you to control the sharpness and blur within your image. A wide depth of field, achieved by using a small aperture, ensures that both the foreground and background are in focus, allowing the viewer to explore the scene in detail. On the other hand, a shallow depth of field, accomplished with a wide aperture, can isolate a specific subject or element, creating a sense of depth and emphasizing its importance within the frame. Understanding how to manipulate depth of field will add dimension and visual interest to your landscape. 9. EXPLORING MINIMALISM: SIMPLIFYING THE SCENE In landscape photography, sometimes less is more. Embracing minimalism allows you to simplify your compositions, focusing on key elements and creating a sense of calm and tranquillity within your images. Look for scenes with a strong focal point or a single element that catches your eye. It could be a lone tree, a rock formation, or a single flower in a vast field. By simplifying the scene and eliminating any distractions, you can draw attention to the beauty and significance of the chosen element. Pay attention to negative space and use it to create a sense of balance and harmony within your composition. Experiment with different angles, focal lengths, and depth of field to create minimalist compositions that evoke a sense of serenity and allow the viewer to appreciate the beauty of the landscape in its purest form. 10. EXPLORING CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL LANDSCAPES: TELLING STORIES THROUGH PHOTOGRAPHY Landscape photography is not limited to capturing natural scenery; it can also be a powerful tool for documenting and preserving cultural and historical landscapes. These landscapes are imbued with stories, traditions, and a sense of heritage that can be conveyed through your photographs. Whether it's an ancient castle perched on a hilltop, a centuries-old tree with a rich history, or a traditional villag nting and preserving cultural and historical landscapes. These landscapes are imbued with stories, traditions, and a sense of heritage that can be conveyed through your photographs. Whether it's an ancient castle perched on a hilltop, a centuries-old tree with a rich history, or a traditional village nestled in the countryside, cultural and historical landscapes offer a wealth of photographic opportunities. Take the time to research the significance and history of the location you are photographing, as this knowledge will inform your compositions and help you capture the essence of the place. Look for unique architectural details, cultural events, or local traditions that can add depth and context to your images. 11. EXPLORING THE DETAILS While landscapes are often associated with vast vistas and sweeping panoramas, macro photography allows you to explore the natural world's intricate details and hidden beauty. Summer is a season teeming with life, from delicate flowers and buzzing insects to intricate textures and patterns that can be captured up close. Invest in a macro lens or extension tubes to get closer to your subjects and reveal the hidden world that exists within them. Look for interesting textures, colourful flowers, or tiny creatures that can be transformed into stunning works of art through macro photography. Pay attention to lighting, using diffusers or reflectors to soften harsh shadows and highlight the intricate details of your subjects. Experiment with different compositions, angles, and depths of field to create visually captivating images that showcase the beauty and complexity of the natural world on a small scale. 12. POST-PROCESSING: ENHANCING YOUR IMAGES Post-processing is integral to landscape photography, allowing you to fine-tune and enhance your images to match your artistic vision. Use editing software to adjust exposure, contrast, saturation, and sharpness, bringing out the details and colours of the landscape. However, it is important to maintain a balance and avoid over-processing, as it can result in unnatural-looking images. Experiment with different editing techniques and find a style that complements your vision while staying true to the essence of the landscape. 13. INSPIRING YOUR CREATIVITY: DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM OTHERS In landscape photography, inspiration can be found in the works of other photographers who have captured the beauty of nature in their own unique way. Explore the portfolios of renowned landscape photographers, study their compositions, lighting techniques, and use of colour, and let their work ignite your own creativity. Additionally, immerse yourself in nature, observe its patterns, colours, and textures, and let it guide you in creating your own visual masterpieces. 14.

Through your lens, you have the power to capture the essence of the landscape, evoke emotions, and inspire others to appreciate and protect our planet.

INVESTING IN PROFESSIONAL TUITION FOR GROWTHView fullsizephotography basics----------------------------------------PHOTOGRAPHY BASICS 1. KNOW YOUR CAMERA AND EQUIPMENT To begin your journey towards mastering photography, you must have a solid understanding of your camera and equipment. Review the manual and familiarise yourself with your camera's different functions, settings, and capabilities. Knowing how to adjust the aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and other settings will give you greater control over your images. In addition to your camera, invest in essential accessories such as lenses, tripods, and filters. Each piece of equipment serves a specific purpose and can significantly enhance your photography. Experiment with different lenses to capture various perspectives and effects. A tripod will help you stabilise your camera for sharp, long-exposure shots, while filters can add drama, greater exposure control, and creativity to your images. 2. MASTER THE FUNDAMENTALS OF EXPOSURE Understanding exposure is fundamental to creating well-exposed and visually appealing photographs. Exposure refers to the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor, and it is determined by three key elements: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. The aperture controls the amount of light entering the camera through the lens. A wide aperture (low f-number) allows more light and creates a shallow depth of field, perfect for isolating subjects. On the other hand, a narrow aperture (high f-number) reduces the amount of light and increases the depth of field, which is ideal for showing lots of details. The shutter speed determines the duration of time that the camera's sensor is exposed to light. A fast shutter speed freezes motion and is excellent for capturing action shots, while a slow shutter speed creates motion blur and is perfect for long-exposure photography. ISO measures the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. A low ISO setting (e.g., 100) produces sharp images with minimal noise, while a high ISO setting (e.g., 1600 or higher) is helpful in low-light conditions to reduce exposure time but may introduce grain or noise to the image. 3. COMPOSITION TECHNIQUES FOR CAPTIVATING IMAGES Composition is the arrangement of visual elements within a photograph. It is a crucial aspect of photography that can make or break an image. By applying composition techniques, you can create visually appealing and impactful photographs. The rule of thirds is a popular composition technique that divides the frame into a grid of nine equal parts using two vertical and two horizontal lines. You create a more balanced and dynamic composition by placing your main subject along these lines or at their intersections. Leading lines are another powerful composition tool. These lines guide the viewer's eye through the image, creating depth and directing attention to the main subject. Look for natural or man-made lines such as roads, rivers, or buildings to incorporate into your compositions. Symmetry and patterns can also add visual interest to your photographs. Find symmetrical subjects or repetitive patterns in your environment and use them as the focal point of your composition. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to create unique and captivating images. 4. UNDERST Symmetry and patterns can also add visual interest to your photographs. Find symmetrical subjects or repetitive patterns in your environment and use them as the focal point of your composition. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to create unique and captivating images. 4. UNDERSTANDING LIGHT AND ITS EFFECTS Light is the essence of photography. It shapes and defines your subjects, sets the mood, and adds depth and dimension to your images. Understanding how light behaves and how to manipulate it will significantly enhance your photography skills. Natural light provides soft and flattering illumination for your subjects. Pay attention to the quality and direction of light throughout the day. The golden hours, shortly after sunrise and before sunset, offer warm and diffused light that adds a beautiful glow to your photographs. Avoid shooting in harsh midday sunlight, which can cast unflattering shadows and create high contrast, unless of course this is what you are working with, then consider mono (B&W) as an option. Alternatively, you can experiment with artificial lighting sources like flash or continuous lights. These tools give you more control over the intensity, direction, and colour of light. Play with different lighting setups to create dramatic portraits, still-life compositions, or even light painting effects. 5. CAPTURING EMOTION AND TELLING A STORY Photography is not just about capturing moments but also about conveying emotions and telling stories. Consider the emotions you want to evoke in your viewers and find creative ways to capture them. To capture genuine and authentic emotions, photograph people in their natural state. Candid shots often result in more compelling and emotionally charged images. Engage with your subjects and create a comfortable environment that allows them to express themselves naturally. In addition to emotions, your photographs can also tell stories. Think about the narrative you want to convey and use elements such as composition, lighting, and subject placement to enhance the storytelling aspect of your images. A well-executed storytelling photograph can engage viewers and leave a lasting impression. 6. EXPLORING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND ANGLES Exploring different perspectives and angles can add a unique and creative touch to your photographs. Instead of shooting from eye level, challenge yourself to think outside the box and experiment with unconventional viewpoints. Getting down low and shooting from a worm's-eye view can make your subjects appear larger than life and create a sense of grandeur. On the other hand, shooting from a bird's-eye view can provide a fresh and unique perspective, especially when photographing landscapes or crowded scenes. Consider the foreground and background elements in your compositions. Including interesting foreground elements can add depth and lead the viewer's eye into the frame. Experiment with different angles and heights to find your subject's most visually appealing composition. 7. EDITING AND POST-PROCESSING FOR STUNNING RESULTS Editing and post-processing are crucial in enhancing your photographs and bringing out their full potential. With the advancements in technology, numerous software options are available to help you edit and refine your images. Start by organising your photos and selecting the best on Editing and post-processing are crucial in enhancing your photographs and bringing out their full potential. With the advancements in technology, numerous software options are available to help you edit and refine your images. Start by organising your photos and selecting the best ones for editing. Use software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop to adjust the exposure, contrast, colour balance, and other parameters to achieve the desired look and feel. Experiment with different editing techniques, but remember to maintain a natural and realistic appearance. Post-processing also allows you to correct any imperfections or distractions in your images. Remove dust spots, unwanted objects, or distractions using the spot healing brush or clone stamp tool. Don't be afraid to experiment with creative editing techniques, such as black and white conversion or adding selective lighting effects, to further enhance your images. 8. CONTINUOUS LEARNING AND WORKSHOP EXPERIENCES Photography is a never-ending journey of learning and growth. Even experienced photographers constantly seek new knowledge and techniques to improve their craft. Engaging in continuous learning opportunities like workshops and classes can significantly enhance your photography skills. Investing in professional tuition and gaining workshop experiences provide you with structured learning methods and personalised development. Workshops offer a hands-on approach, allowing you to practice new techniques and receive immediate feedback from experienced instructors. They also provide valuable networking opportunities, allowing you to connect with other photographers and learn from their experiences. Additionally, workshops often occur in inspiring locations, providing unique subject matter and beautiful backdrops for your photographs. By immersing yourself in these learning experiences, you'll improve your technical skills and gain a deeper understanding of the art and the ability to express your unique vision. 9. BUILDING A PORTFOLIO AND SHOWCASING YOUR WORK As you progress on your photography journey, building a portfolio to showcase your best work is essential. A portfolio is a collection of your strongest images representing your unique style and vision as a photographer. Select your best photographs across different genres and create a cohesive and visually appealing portfolio. Consider the sequencing and flow of your images to create a narrative or tell a story. You can create a physical portfolio to present in person or build an online portfolio using platforms like Instagram or other dedicated photo sites. Regularly update your portfolio with new and improved work to reflect your growth and evolution as a photographer. Sharing your portfolio with others, whether through online platforms or in-person exhibitions, allows you to receive feedback, gain exposure, and potentially attract clients or opportunities for collaboration. 10. INVESTING IN PROFESSIONAL TUITION FOR GROWTH While self-learning and experimentation are valuable, investing in professional tuition can accelerate your growth as a photographer. Professional instructors can provide guidance, personalized feedback, and expert knowledge to help you overcome challenges and reach new heights in your photography journey. Consider enrolling in photography courses or workshops led by experienced photogr te your growth as a photographer.

THE NIK COLLECTION HAS BEEN A PHOTOGRAPHER'S FAVOURITE FOR YEARS WITH ITS POWERFUL PLUGINS AND INNOVATIVE TOOLS. AND NOW, WITH THE RELEASE OF DXO NIK COLLECTION 6, THERE ARE EVEN MORE EXCITING FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXPLORE.THE EVOLUTION OF NIK COLLECTION 6The NIK Collection has come a long way since its launch in the '90s. Over the years, it has changed ownership several times, but its reputation for its black-and-white and colour film looks has remained legendary. Today, DXO is the proud owner of the NIK Collection, and they continue to improve and enhance the software with each new version.INTRODUCING NIK COLLECTION 6NIK Collection 6 by DXO is the latest version of this powerful photo editing suite. Packed with new features and improvements, it offers photographers even more control and flexibility in their editing process. Whether you're a professional photographer or an amateur enthusiast, NIK Collection 6 has something to offer.ENHANCED U POINTTM TOOLOne of the standout features of NIK Collection 6 is the enhanced U PointTM tool. This innovative tool has been upgraded with new Control Lines, allowing you to combine the power of Control Points with the flexibility of linear gradients. With C on 6 has something to offer.ENHANCED U POINTTM TOOLOne of the standout features of NIK Collection 6 is the enhanced U PointTM tool. This innovative tool has been upgraded with new Control Lines, allowing you to combine the power of Control Points with the flexibility of linear gradients. With Control Lines, you can create graduated filter effects with precision and ease. Whilst this is an excellent addition to the plugin, I tend to make this type of adjustment in Lightroom before using NIK or refine it after using NIK.In addition to Control Lines, the U PointTM tool now includes Color Selectivity filters. These filters allow you to tie the impact of Control Points and Control Lines to the brightness and colour of specific parts of your image. This level of control gives you unparalleled precision in your local adjustments.INVERTED AND DIFFUSED ADJUSTMENTSNIK Collection 6 introduces the ability to invert and diffuse your Control Points and Control Lines. This means you can apply adjustments to specific areas of your image and then easily reverse or soften those adjustments as needed. This level of flexibility allows you to experiment and fine-tune your edits confidently.IMPROVED WORKFLOW FEATURESIn addition to the enhancements to the U PointTM tool, NIK Collection 6 also brings a range of improvements to the overall workflow. One of the notable improvements is the ability to save and rename your local adjustments. This means you can keep track of all your fine edits and easily access them whenever you need further adjustments.Another helpful feature is choosing where you want the adjustment sliders to appear. You can keep them in the sidebar for a clean interface or have them on top of your image for easy adjustments. NIK Collection 6 also allows you to save your local adjustments as part of your presets, making it even easier to apply quick changes to your images.SMART OBJECTS AND PRESETSNIK Collection 6 introduces new features that make your editing process even more non-destructive. You can now turn your edits into Smart Objects, allowing you to make adjustments without permanently altering your original image. This gives you the freedom to experiment and make changes without fearing losing any critical details.Presets are another powerful tool in NIK Collection 6. You can now search for presets by name, making it easier to find your favourite edits. With just a few clicks, you can apply your saved presets to your images, saving you time and ensuring consistency in your edits.UPDATED AND REBUILT PLUGINSNIK Collection 6 brings updates and rebuilds to several of its plugins. Nik Color Efex, one of the most popular plugins in the collection, now includes a brand-new Hue/Saturation/Luminance tool. This tool gives you deeper and more accurate control over the colour and tone of your images. * Nik Dfine, another essential plugin in the collection, has received a complete visual overhaul. The new interface aligns it with the other plugins, creating a more refined editing experience. Additionally, you can save denoising profiles and easily return to them in just a few clicks. * Nik Perspective, known for its powerful geometric adjustments, now features the impressive ReShape tool. This tool allows you to warp and shape local areas of your image, giving you total precision in correcting geometry and creating artistic effects. * The Nik Sharpener plugin will receive a rebuild and interface overhaul in a futu ful geometric adjustments, now features the impressive ReShape tool. This tool allows you to warp and shape local areas of your image, giving you total precision in correcting geometry and creating artistic effects. * The Nik Sharpener plugin will receive a rebuild and interface overhaul in a future update, while Nik HDR Efex will get a fresh new interface in an upcoming release.

It doesn’t take rocket science to turn your everyday snaps into inspiring pieces of art, worthy of comment; using my knowledge, I have written this step-by-step guide on how to grow your photography skills:TOOLS OF THE TRADE ARE ESSENTIAL.It’s not necessary to have the biggest and best camera on the market – or even to possess a digital camera. Film cameras are just as relevant and useful today as they were prior to the digital age. The most important thing is to get suitable equipment for your individual requirements and expertise.HAVE YOUR CAMERA AT THE READYCarry your camera around with you, whenever possible. You might find yourself suddenly looking at a stunning scene: but if your camera isn’t with you, you miss out on what potentially may have been your best shot to date. However, it is rare for these opportunities to just present themselves to you. You need to get out into the world and look for them. Day or night, dry or wet, warm or cold – all conditions are perfect for the right photo, at the right time.INSPIRATION IS EVERYWHEREThere are so many colours, textures and patterns around you just waiting to be discovered and incorporated into original and stunning photographs. I offer a ran m. Day or night, dry or wet, warm or cold – all conditions are perfect for the right photo, at the right time.INSPIRATION IS EVERYWHEREThere are so many colours, textures and patterns around you just waiting to be discovered and incorporated into original and stunning photographs. I offer a range of workshops where you can learn so much in the beautiful British outdoors. Hone your skills and create enchanting photos for people to admire and enjoy. You can even customise your tuition to suit your specific needs with my pick and mix tuition packages.SIMPLICITY IS BEAUTYAvoid trying to focus on too much at once. If there is something that doesn’t add anything to the composition of the shot, then it doesn’t need to be included. Keep it simple and you’ll get a much more focused shot.SHARE YOUR WORKAn important part of your development is sharing your photos with the world and receiving feedback. Listening to constructive criticism from other artists is one of the best ways to improve the way you work. They’ll understand the impact you would like your photos to have; they may see ways as to how you can tailor your skills to achieve those goals. Full constructive feedback is given throughout all my courses, together with ongoing support, taking you further along the creative journey of the craft of photography.KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT - BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHERKnowing all about the extras on high-tech digital cameras isn’t essential, but it is useful in getting the most out of your shots. Don’t be afraid to experiment with your equipment as well as researching the range of tools available to you.FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH HOW YOU WORK - BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHERDo you feel at your best out in the elements of nature or surrounded by busy town life?

      "articleBody": "CAMERA BAGS - REVIEW OF MANFROTTO BACKPACK ADVANCED FAST IIIMANFROTTO BACKPACK - ADVANCED FAST IIIIn photography, having a reliable, high-quality camera bag is essential. Whether you're a professional photographer shooting landscapes or a casual hobbyist exploring new locations, the right camera bag can make all the difference in your experience. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is a versatile and functional option that meets the needs of photographers in various fields. In this article, we will explore the features and benefits of this innovative camera bag and discuss how to choose the right bag for your needs.Before we get into the details, I want to admit to being a camera bag junky - In twenty years of being an active photographer, I think I have massed the equivalent of a bag a year for my needs. Weirdly my needs haven’t changed that much over time. The quantity of gear I take out on a workshop or my own wanderings is pretty standard for the most part. However, bags age faster than me with exposure to all weather conditions and bundled in and out of the car, on my back, or the ground. Sometimes I want to travel with one lens and maybe a couple of accessories, filters, spare battery, water bottle, lunch box etc. other times, I want to take two or even three lenses and more. So, over the years, I have leaned towards having two types of camera bags. Though I still constantly question whether there is something in between that does it all. I’ve not found s, filters, spare battery, water bottle, lunch box etc. other times, I want to take two or even three lenses and more. So, over the years, I have leaned towards having two types of camera bags. Though I still constantly question whether there is something in between that does it all. I’ve not found it yet but have come close to it with my current main bag . Which I am more than happy with to date. 1. Small but big enough to carry a camera body and one lens, plus a small amount of accessories and a water bottle. The day pack. 2. Large but still convenient for weight, comfort, space and versatility. i.e. I can include clothing (hat, gloves, jacket), a flask and a water bottle, filters, and other accessories.The review of this bag falls into the first category of the all-day, one-day type, where you need a range of options for multiple lenses, filters and other equipment and clothing. Therefore a 15ltr - 25ltr capacity is usually adequate. This bag falls in the middle of this range at 18.5ltr volume.----------------------------------------HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT CAMERA BAG FOR YOUWhen selecting a camera bag, it's essential to consider your specific needs and requirements. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing the right bag for you:KEY CAMERA BAG REQUIREMENTS 1. Protection of gear: Ensure the bag offers adequate padding and protection for your valuable equipment. 2. Comfort and weight: Look for a bag with an ergonomic design and padded straps to minimize strain during transport. 3. Versatility and space: Consider the gear you need to carry and ensure the bag offers enough compartments and access points to accommodate your needs. 4. Overall size: If you travel frequently, ensure the bag meets carry-on luggage standards for your preferred airline or has so much space that you overpack it and damage your back. 5. Quality of materials: Opt for a bag made from high-quality, durable materials to ensure longevity and performance.I should probably add a sixth point - Cost but when you consider the cost of your gear running into the thousands very quickly these days, I don’t think spending 10% of that on a decent bag to protect it and use it as you want to is something to be compromised.----------------------------------------REVIEW OF THE MANFROTTO ADVANCED FAST BACKPACK IIITHE FEATURESPROTECTION OF GEAROne of the most critical aspects of a camera bag is its protection of your valuable photography equipment. Manfrotto has considered this with the Advanced Fast Backpack III, featuring their new M-Guard™ Protection System. This system uses high-density EVA foam to provide exceptional shock absorption and a slim profile for added space efficiency.M-GUARD™ PROTECTION SYSTEMThe M-Guard™ Protection System in the Advanced Fast Backpack III ensures that your gear remains safe and secure during transport. The customized folding patterns of the foam padding allow for maximum versatility and protection while maximizing the use of space within the bag.COMFORT AND WEIGHTAnother essential factor when selecting a camera bag is the comfort it provides, especially during long hours of shooting or traveling. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed with padded shoulder straps and a comfortable back panel to ensure that carrying your gear is a breeze.ERGONOMIC DESIGNThe ergonomic design of the backpack helps distribute weight evenly, reducing the strain on y urs of shooting or traveling. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed with padded shoulder straps and a comfortable back panel to ensure that carrying your gear is a breeze.ERGONOMIC DESIGNThe ergonomic design of the backpack helps distribute weight evenly, reducing the strain on your shoulders and back. This is particularly important for landscape photographers who often have to hike long distances with their equipment.VERSATILITY AND SPACEThe Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed to be extremely versatile, with multiple access points and compartments to accommodate a wide range of gear. The bag can hold a full-frame mirrorless camera with an attached 70-200 mm f/4 lens, three additional lenses, a flash, and a 15-inch laptop.DUAL SIDE ACCESS AND QUICK TOP ACCESSThe backpack features dual side access to the main gear compartment, as well as quick top access for additional space. This allows you to easily retrieve your equipment without having to completely open the bag. The top compartment can be used for personal items or a second camera body, depending on your needs.OVERALL SIZEThe overall size of the camera bag is crucial for photographers who need to travel frequently or carry their gear over long distances. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed to meet the standard for carry-on luggage, allowing you to bring it on board most flights without any issues.CABIN LUGGAGE COMPATIBILITYDue to ever-changing restrictions, it's essential to check with your airline before departure. However, the Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed to fit within most carry-on luggage limitations, making it a convenient choice for photographers on the go.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - QUALITY OF MATERIALSThe materials used in a camera bag play a significant role in its durability and performance. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is made from high-quality, water-repellant fabric, ensuring your gear stays dry even in adverse weather conditions.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - WATER REPELLENT FABRIC AND RAIN COVERThe external fabric of the backpack is treated to repel water, and the bag also comes with an included rain cover for additional protection. This ensures that your equipment remains safe and dry, even in the most challenging environments.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - ADDITIONAL FEATURESThe Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III boasts several additional features that make it an excellent choice for photographers of all levels.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - EXTERNAL TRIPOD CONNECTIONSThe bag comes with proper connections to attach your tripod externally, ensuring you can bring along all the necessary equipment for your shoot.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - INTERCHANGEABLE DIVIDERSThe backpack includes modular and easy-to-use dividers that allow you to custom-fit the interior of the bag to accommodate your specific gear. This ensures that everything remains secure and organized during transport.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - LAPTOP COMPARTMENTThe Advanced Fast Backpack III features a dedicated, padded compartment for a 15-inch laptop, ensuring your computer stays safe during transport.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - TABLET COMPARTMENTIn addition to the laptop compartment, the bag also includes a dedicated compartment for a tablet, providing even more versatility for photographers who need to stay connected on the go.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - TROLLEY CONNECTIONFor easy transportation, the backpack features a designated MPARTMENTIn addition to the laptop compartment, the bag also includes a dedicated compartment for a tablet, providing even more versatility for photographers who need to stay connected on the go.MANFROTTO BACKPACK - TROLLEY CONNECTIONFor easy transportation, the backpack features a designated strap connector that slides over any standard trolley or luggage handle. This makes navigating airports and other busy environments much more manageable.----------------------------------------TESTING IN THE FLESHI approached the review of this bag with the parameters of whether it would provide what is needed for a one-day day trip or equivalent.MY CRITERIA FOR THAT WOULD BE: * Camera body and two or three lenses * Filters (Kase Revolution) ND’s and Polariser. * A rain jacket * Lunch Box & snacks * Two Flasks - of water and coffee * Spare battery and a small number of other accessoriesI packed the Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III accordinglyIt’s worth saying up-front that this is an 18.5ltr capacity bag, so it’s fair to say that you can pack a lot of gear into something similar to most laptop/work backpacks.However, I struggled to get everything needed into such a small space without compromising on ease of access and protection. Let’s walk through the negatives and positives.NEGATIVES - MANFROTTO BACKPACK * Access & Opening - I wouldn’t say I like the front opening access to the camera section - the butterfly design means accessing anything in that area exposes everything to the elements, wind, rain and dust. If your bag were lying on an uneven surface, there would undoubtedly be a risk of items rolling out. Why all bags are not clamshell openings so the back of the pack that goes onto to your back is kept dry and clean is a mystery to me. * Width - with only 27cm internal width, my mirrorless body with a mount converter and 70-200mm lens was butted up tight to both sides of the bag. I tried switching the configuration of the dividers but couldn’t find a convenient arrangement where everything in that section was secure and protected sufficiently. * Space - whilst I could squeeze in my mirrorless body with a lens and two additional lenses, this made the side pockets redundant - I tried to fit a water bottle into the side pocket. Still, the pocket lacked expandable space, so it was impossible to use for a flask or water bottle to either side or both sides. * Top Space - It’s minimal, and you can about get away with a small lunch box and cagoule-type jacket, but forget trying to pack any padded/thicker clothing in too.POSITIVES - MANFROTTO BACKPACK * Size - The bag is compact and meets carry-on requirements so if you want to carry a limited amount of gear and accessories, you should be able to get away with using this to carry your gear. * Materials - if you don’t overpack it, the bag should give you adequate protection with its sturdy internal dividers and side padding. * Cost - It’s within the budget of many beginners and may work well enough as their first all-rounder bag.SUMMARY - MANFROTTO BACKPACKWhile the Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III offers some promising features, such as versatile access points, a dedicated laptop compartment, and water repellant fabric, it may not be the ideal choice for all photographers. The limited space for additional items and the front-opening design could prove to be inconvenient for those who require a more adaptable and secure camera bag. P ersatile access points, a dedicated laptop compartment, and water repellant fabric, it may not be the ideal choice for all photographers. The limited space for additional items and the front-opening design could prove to be inconvenient for those who require a more adaptable and secure camera bag. Photography Shop With over twenty years of experience and numerous camera bags tested, it is essential to prioritize the right size, quality, versatility, and accessibility when choosing a camera bag. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III may serve some photographers well in the interim, but it may not be the perfect solution for various trips and shooting scenarios.View fullsizeMY VERDICT OUT OF FIVE 1. PROTECTION OF GEAR: 3/5 - AWKWARD FRONT OPENING + LACK OF PADDING TO THE FRONT 2. COMFORT AND WEIGHT: 3/5 - FOR ITS SIZE, IT’S COMFORTABLE EVEN WHEN FULLY LOADED, BUT THE LACK OF A STERNUM STRAP SEEMS QUESTIONABLE 3. VERSATILITY AND SPACE: 2/5 - DEEP CAMERA SECTION COULD BE IMPROVED, AND THE INTERNAL WIDTH OF 27CM RESTRICTS WHAT YOU CAN REALISTICALLY CARRY IF YOU WANT TO USE SIDE POCKETS. 4. OVERALL SIZE: 4/5 - IT MEETS CARRY-ON REQUIREMENTS, AND WITH A SINGLE BODY AND ONE ADDITIONAL LENS PLUS A SMALL NUMBER OF ACCESSORIES, IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS 5. QUALITY OF MATERIALS: 3/5 - INTERNAL DIVIDERS ARE RIGID, AND EXTERNAL SURFACES ARE OKAY BUT WON’T TOLERATE A DOWNPOUR (THOUGH A RAIN COVER IS INCLUDED) OR GENERAL GRIME AND DIRT. COST - FOR A £100 BAG IT ISN’T TERRIBLE BUT IN MY VIEW ISN’T FANTASTIC EITHER -OVERALL SCORE - 3/5photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 31 May 2023news , reviews LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

WHO’S THE BOOK WRITTEN FOR?For less experienced users, the Fast Track weaves its way through the book, with short tutorials that guide you through a simple workflow, allowing you to gain confidence before diving into the more advanced questions. The book also includes a chapter on the concepts behind editing photos and how these translate into Lightroom adjustments, ideal for anyone new to photo editing.

AND A 10% DISCOUNT FOR MY CLIENTS - AFFILIATED PARTNERFilters in landscape photography have been a standard part of the kit bag. NDs, Graduated NDs, and polariser filters have allowed us to improve the dynamic range and exposure tonal range and create those long exposure on moving subjects (water/sky). I have always taught my clients why and how we use the three filters to improve the in-camera image. See this previous blog post for explanations on filters. For years I have recommended the Lee Filter system , and I still do for certain types of images; however, over the last few years, I have rarely used the graduated filters that are required to control difficult lighting situations with bright highlights (e.g. the sky) versus darker shadows (e.g. underneath trees or shaded areas).WHY NOT, YOU MAY ASK? WELL, THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS TWO-FOLD. 1. I have found that the dynamic range of sensors in the new camera models has improved so much over the last five years that even if I have the dreaded U-shaped histogram with a lack of mid-tone tonal range, there has been enough data recorded to adjust without too much downside in post-production. If I need an insurance policy, it’s effortless and quick to take a three-bracketed exposure from minus two to plus two and then blend in post. 2. Maybe it’s my ageing body and mind, but the energy required to get out the filter kit, ensure the filters are clean, position them all and so on meant that I don’t mind admitting laziness or not having enough time or just that the fact that it may be damp/drizzly and so on. In those situations, I ended up just taking bracketed exposures.At the back end of last year, I looked at alternative options because NDs are still required for long exposures and, without question, a polarising filter for most of my outdoor photography, especially for woodlands. I wanted something to use that was simple, quick and easy to access and use. My search coincided with the launch of the already highly rated Kase Wolverine system that many pro togs and tutors use with Kase’s new update to that system with the “ Revolution - Kase Magnetic Circular Filters.”VERDICTI purchased the new Kase Revolution Pro Kit with various step-up rings, a hood and adapters. I was ready to put everything to the test across three different lenses and reduce the space taken up, in my camera bag, by my Lee filter system to about 25% of the size and 70% of the weight. Yes, okay, it meant an expenditure of approximately £450. Still, after taking the kit out on variou apters. I was ready to put everything to the test across three different lenses and reduce the space taken up, in my camera bag, by my Lee filter system to about 25% of the size and 70% of the weight. Yes, okay, it meant an expenditure of approximately £450. Still, after taking the kit out on various workshops and using it, I was delighted with how easy it was to use clean and interchange filters.Cleaning may seem minor, but trust my experience of working on coastlines, drizzle and rain and having to spend too long to clear rain-drops, smudges, and so on the glass and coating on the Kase filters far outweighs my experience of trying to clean Lee filters. Colour cast/glass quality was vital, and the colour-coded filters made it so much easier for my failing eyes to identify which filter strength to pull out of the 12cmx12cm pouch.FROM KASE’S SITE:KEY FEATURES * Colour coded filters * Backwards compatible with existing Magnetic Circular filters, adapters, hoods and step rings * New Inlaid ring to help prevent vignetting on a wide-angle lens * Magnetic Stackable Mounting * Toughened Pro HD Optical Glass * No Discernible Colour Cast * Scratch Resistant * Metallic Nano Coatings * Water and Dust/Dirt Repellent * Easy CleanIN THE BOX * Magnetic Lens Adapter ( 77mm, 82mm and 95mm Options) You need to go one size bigger than your lens to avoid vignetting * White colour-coded Magnetic Circular Polariser * Blue colour-coded ND8 (3 stop) Neutral Density Filter * Yellow colour-coded ND64 (6 stop) Neutral Density Filter * Red colour-coded ND1000 (10 stop) Neutral Density Filter * 77mm, 82mm or 95m Inlaid Ring - Depending on your lens diameters. * FREE Magnetic Lens Cap * Carry Pouch----------------------------------------OFFERS FOR MY CLIENTSKITS FROM £230 -Kase Filter systems * My Existing Clients Receive 10% Off - Please email me so I can verify you are my client and provide you with the discount code for any Kase products as an affiliated partner. * Free consultation with me on what sizes and adapters/kit works best across your lenses.Kase Filtershttps://kasefilters.com/ref/alan.ranger/Kase Revolution Circular Filter Systemhttps://kasefilters.com/ref/alan.ranger/Colour Coded for ease of identification and magnetic----------------------------------------news , photography-offers , recommended-products , tip-of-the-day , lightroom Alan Ranger 14 May 2023Alan Ranger Photography news , filters LinkedIn0 Tumblr 0 Likes",

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHY CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERS - 3 BASIC COMPONENTSARE YOU AN ASPIRING PHOTOGRAPHER LOOKING TO LEARN THE BASICS OF PHOTOGRAPHY?DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE KEY ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP A CAPTIVATING PHOTOGRAPH?LOOK NO FURTHER! THIS GUIDE, “PHOTOGRAPHY CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERS”, WILL DELVE INTO THE THREE BASIC COMPONENTS THAT EVERY BEGINNER PHOTOGRAPHER SHOULD KNOW. BY MASTERING THESE CONCEPTS, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY SKILLS TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND CAPTURE STUNNING IMAGES THAT TRULY RESONATE WITH YOUR AUDIENCE. WHETHER YOU'RE INTERESTED IN LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY, PORTRAITURE, OR STREET PHOTOGRAPHY, THESE CONCEPTS WILL SERVE AS A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR YOUR PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY. THIS ARTICLE ASSUMES YOU HAVE ALREADY ACQUIRED THE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF EXPOSURE (APERTURE, SHUTTER, ISO) AND HAVE NOW EMBARKED ON THE JOURNEY TO CREATING BETTER PICTURES.Photography Concepts for BeginnersPHOTOGRAPHY CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERSUNDERSTANDING THE THREE MAIN ELEMENTS OF PHOTOGRAPHY : THE PHOTOPhotography is a blend of art and science, and understanding its basic components is essential for creating impactful images. As a beginner, it's crucial to familiarise yourself with the three main elements that make up a photograph: subject, light, and composition. Let's explore each of these components in detail. * SUBJECT: THE HEART OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHThe subject is the main focus of your photograph. It's what catches your eye and draws you into the image. When desc with the three main elements that make up a photograph: subject, light, and composition. Let's explore each of these components in detail. * SUBJECT: THE HEART OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHThe subject is the main focus of your photograph. It's what catches your eye and draws you into the image. When describing a photo, the subject is often the first thing we mention. It could be a person, an object, or a scene. A powerful photograph captures the essence of the subject and presents it in a visually compelling way.To portray your subject effectively, consider how you want to present it. Do you want to isolate it with a shallow depth of field, or do you want everything in focus? Will your photograph be sharp and detailed, or more artistic and blurred? These technical decisions are creative choices that allow you to showcase your subject in the best possible light. * LIGHT: PAINTING WITH ILLUMINATIONLight is the lifeblood of photography. It determines the mood, atmosphere, and visual impact of your images. Understanding how to manipulate light is crucial for creating stunning photographs. Different qualities of light evoke different emotions and can transform an ordinary scene into something extraordinary.Consider the quality, direction, and color of light when composing your shot. The quality of light refers to its hardness or softness. Hard light creates strong shadows and sharp edges, while soft light produces gentle transitions. The direction of light influences the depth and dimensionality of your subject. Experiment with lighting from different angles to achieve the desired effect. Lastly, the color of light can dramatically alter the atmosphere of your photograph. From warm golden hues to cool blue tones, understanding how to work with different lighting conditions will greatly enhance your images. * COMPOSITION: CRAFTING A VISUAL STORYComposition is the arrangement of elements within your photograph. It is the art of visual storytelling and plays a crucial role in creating impactful images. By considering the placement, balance, and framing of your subjects, you can guide the viewer's eye and convey your intended message.There are various techniques and guidelines that can help you compose your photographs effectively. The rule of thirds, for example, divides the frame into nine equal parts and suggests placing points of interest along the lines or at their intersections. Leading lines can draw the viewer's gaze into the image, while negative space can create a sense of balance and simplicity. Experiment with different compositions to find what works best for your subject and message.Learning Photography Concepts for Beginners is merely the start of your journey - putting those concepts into practise is a key element if you want to progress: Next we discuss five ways to practise the photography concepts for beginners with this short but invaluable guide.----------------------------------------FIVE WAYS TO PRACTISE PHOTOGRAPHY CONCEPTS FOR BEGINNERSTHE IMPORTANCE OF PROBLEM-SOLVING IN PHOTOGRAPHYAs a beginner photographer, it's essential to develop a problem-solving mindset. Every photoshoot presents its challenges, and learning from your mistakes is crucial for growth. When reviewing your images, take the time to analyze the unsuccessful shots and understand why they didn't meet your expectations. Was it a focus issue, depth of field, or camera shake? By critically assessing your work, you can identify areas f and learning from your mistakes is crucial for growth. When reviewing your images, take the time to analyze the unsuccessful shots and understand why they didn't meet your expectations. Was it a focus issue, depth of field, or camera shake? By critically assessing your work, you can identify areas for improvement and make more informed decisions in future shoots.Remember, photography is not about mindlessly capturing hundreds of frames and hoping for a good shot. It's about being intentional, creative, and disciplined in your approach. Embrace the freedom to experiment while adhering to the principles and techniques that yield the best results. By doing so, you'll sharpen your skills and develop a unique photographic style.DEVELOPING YOUR PHOTOGRAPHIC VISIONWhile mastering the technical aspects of photography is important, it's equally crucial to develop your own artistic vision. What story do you want to tell through your photographs? What emotions do you want to evoke in your viewers? Take the time to explore different genres, study the work of renowned photographers, and experiment with various subjects and styles. This process of self-discovery will help you find your unique voice in the world of photography.THE POWER OF PERSONAL PROJECTSEngaging in personal projects is an excellent way to refine your skills and explore your photographic vision. Choose a specific theme or concept that resonates with you and challenge yourself to create a series of images around it. This focused approach will not only deepen your technical abilities but also allow you to develop a cohesive body of work that showcases your personal style.LEARNING FROM THE EXPERTSWhile self-guided learning is valuable, enrolling in photography classes or workshops can accelerate your growth as a photographer. These educational experiences provide structured learning environments, expert guidance, and opportunities for constructive feedback. Whether it's through online courses, local workshops, or mentorship programs, investing in your education will undoubtedly enhance your understanding of photography concepts and techniques.EMBRACING THE JOURNEYPhotography is a lifelong journey of discovery, growth, and self-expression. It's a medium that allows you to capture moments, tell stories, and share your unique perspective with the world. By understanding the fundamental concepts of subject, light, and composition, and by cultivating problem-solving skills and personal vision, you'll unlock your creative potential and create photographs that truly resonate with others.Remember, photography is not just about technical proficiency; it's about capturing the essence of a moment and evoking emotions in your viewers. Embrace the joy of learning, explore new horizons, and never stop honing your craft. With dedication, practice, and a thirst for knowledge, you can become the photographer you aspire to be. So grab your camera, step out into the world, and let your creativity soar!Additional Information: Join our photography classes or workshops and embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery through the art of photography.

      "articleBody": "5 STAGES TO IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY | A PROFESSIONAL GUIDEMY APPROACHIS TO IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHYOver twenty years of being a landscape/outdoor photographer and turning my passion into a professional status and a business over ten years ago, I have led thousands of outdoor workshops and classes for clients of all abilities, gear, interests, backgrounds, ages and needs. Throughout this period I have developed many techniques, explanations and events to improve your photography> I started my teaching ethos on the understanding that \"Pictures are the expression of the photographer; they reflect perception and individuality, portraying a journey through life.\"Therefore, there are not necessarily rights and wrongs in photography; there is only the ability for each individual to bring their own creative and beautiful vision into the images they make for the purpose required. It does not mean that certain aspects of the execution, focusing, exposure, composition and so on can be ignored, they are essential elements of an image, but they are not the reason for making the image.> PHOTOGRAPHY IS A MEDIUM TO RECORD AND EXPRESS MOMENTS, IDEALS, CONNECTIONS, AND INTERPRETATIONS OF WHAT WE FIND BEAUTIFUL, INTRIGUING OR IMPORTANT. ----------------------------------------Based on these principles, I have created a flexible approach to everyone and use a straightforward methodology to help each person get the most out of every interaction with me as their tutor.

THE PHOTOGRAPHIC WORKFLOW: TO IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHYThe five linear stages of creating a photograph.see | design | shoot | enhance | share. 1. See - The ability to observe and develop your creative eye. 2. Design - The ability to disclose only the vital and compose. 3. Shoot - The ability to create the best digital negative. 4. Enhance - The ability to edit the image to realise its potential. 5. Share - The ability to share images for enjoyment/outcomes.The Photographic Process----------------------------------------5 STAGES TO IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHYBased on the five stages of the photographic process, I teach people through explanations, cues, demonstrations and suggestions throughout each step. I won't instruct clients and what to shoot but help them on how to shoot. More often than not, clients want to master their use of the camera (shoot) first before improving their ability to observe (see), compose (design) and edit (enhance). This is the learning workflow where the stages are rearranged to give learning and development to where it is most wanted (needed is another debate). It is a continuous improvement cycle where we all seek to improve our abilities at any stage to bring more satisfaction and enjoyment to our photography.THE PHOTOGRAPHIC LEARNING WORKFLOW: TO IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHYshoot| design| enhance | share | see. 1. Camera - Shoot - Learn camera settings and functions and when and how to use them. 2. Composition - Design - Understand how images are composed and why. 3. Editing - Enhance - Learn to use editing software to make critical photo enhancements. 4. Feedback - Share - Feedback on your images and affirmation to progress further. 5. Creativity - See - Expand your creativity through experience, practice, and collaboration./5-steps-to-improve-your-photographyThe Photographic Learning workflow----------------------------------------5 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY 1. See Your capacity to observe, identify, study and create comes through practice and critical thinking at the moment but also after the moment in reflection. Giving your subject full attention requires a mindset and giving yourself time to get into that zone. Often referred to as mindfulness, whatever you call this connection to your topic and environment, it’s an essential part of improving what and how you photograph anything. My outdoor landscape location workshops are a perfect way to experience new places, meet like-minded people and stimulate your ability to observe and see more. Workshops are carefully planned to suit all levels of experience, and 1-2-1 tuition is provided accordingly. Each location is optimised for timing and interest but not pressured into being a honey-pot bus tour to get the classic shots and move on. 2. Design We learn from identifying mistakes and misjudgements and then understanding how and why those errors can be avoided next time. It isn’t a formulaic approach of applying simple textbook rules of thirds, leading lines or any other compositional straight-jackets. Instead, it is about creating balance We learn from identifying mistakes and misjudgements and then understanding how and why those errors can be avoided next time. It isn’t a formulaic approach of applying simple textbook rules of thirds, leading lines or any other compositional straight-jackets. Instead, it is about creating balance, harmony, atmosphere and a connection between the photographer and their subject. Creating that feeling in an image is a craft that examines every aspect of what is included in the frame and asks why? I provide many ways to help you improve your eye for composition and expression. Mentoring/Workshops/Courses/1-2-1 all include image critiques to discuss image design and its intention. 3. Shoot Failing to understand how to use camera settings is a bit like trying to drive a car without a steering wheel; It is impossible to arrive at the desired destination. Steering, in reality, camera settings and, specifically, control of exposure settings are the most important part of photography regarding the mechanics of camera operation. Moving from point and shoot, relying on what the camera does in auto exposure mode to make your own choices about aperture, shutter speed, and ISO are where you first learn the basics of photography. This is essential to your learning and can’t be bypassed if you want to create images beyond phone snapshots. My beginner’s photography course and classes are designed to help you take your first significant step into using your camera with all its power and potential. If evening classes or my locations don’t suit you, these essential basics can be taught online via Zoom or on a 1-2-1 basis. 4. Enhance Editing an image is not a sin, crime or deceitful! Photographs, by their very nature of using a camera, lens and settings, are not the reality if you base them on human perception and vision. There is a case for debating how much editing is acceptable, but I think this is down to the photographer making that choice. Don’t rely on the camera JPG settings to make those choices. Shoot in RAW format, so you have all ingredients available to fine-tune the image to your taste and vision. Editing your images is part of learning how to improve the decisions you make about camera settings, framing and composing your shots. In fact, I would say with confidence that the process of editing is the fastest route to identifying what you didn’t do or see at the moment you took the shot, Learning how to use the editing software of your choice is the first step. It is the how rather than why; then comes the decision of how you want to convey your photographic vocabulary expressing your personal interpretation of your subject. My Beginners Lightroom Course provides all of the basics of how. Through 1-2-1 private lessons , courses and image critiques, we can develop the why further so that you can apply your interpretation to what you want to create. 5. Share Sharing an image is generally about getting some affirmation and feedback about the image you created. Though necessary, it doesn’t have to be, nor should that be, a reason for sharing. Sharing can be as simple as showing your friends and family or getting an image printed and framed to give as a gift or hangin mage is generally about getting some affirmation and feedback about the image you created. Though necessary, it doesn’t have to be, nor should that be, a reason for sharing. Sharing can be as simple as showing your friends and family or getting an image printed and framed to give as a gift or hanging on your walls. Those are great outcomes, but when it comes to learning and development objectives, sharing comes more about confirmation that what you created has some merit. Health Warning - social media popularity or competition success/failure should NOT influence your opinion about your images. The key part of sharing, whether public or collaborating with me, is learning and improving all of the process's previous steps. My courses , workshops , mentoring , and 1-2-1 lessons online or face-to-face all provide the opportunity for constructive feedback and image critiques to improve your photographyphotography-tips , tip-of-the-day Alan Ranger 21 February 2023Alan Ranger Photography LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "SHOOTING IN LOW LIGHT | LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY GUIDESHOOTING IN LOW LIGHT | LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY GUIDEShooting In Low Light – My Top TipsYou might think that photography is limited to the times of day or when we utilise the man-made lights. Daylight isn’t the limit though and there are plenty of ways you can discover the beauty of photography in the darkness of night and poorly lit areas.Here are my top tips to shooting quality images without relying on daylight.Open your apertureThe aperture is the opening inside your lens that opens and closes based on the F number you set to control how much is in focus in the picture - with low light you may need to open your aperture to wider hole (lower F number) to balance depth of focus over exposure time. Experiment with shutter speedThe exposure time is determined by length of time required to capture enough light to expose the photo correctly - this is a calculation based on the Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO setting you set. In Aperture Priority mode (A or AV) the camera meters the frame you are shooting and calculate the shutter speed for you based on the aperture you have set. In S or TV mode you set the shutter speed and the camera calculates the aperture for you. You have to decide which is more important and balance the exposure between aperture and shutter speed according to your requirements for depth of focus and length of exposure - You can of course use ISO to decrease the exposure tim he shutter speed and the camera calculates the aperture for you. You have to decide which is more important and balance the exposure between aperture and shutter speed according to your requirements for depth of focus and length of exposure - You can of course use ISO to decrease the exposure time but at the cost of increased noise/grain in your image.Naturally low light, night images require longer exposures - this can reveal a dramatic image in a way the human eye doesn't see. Both the light and movement in a shot will not be as your eyes witness the scene. To decide on what shutter speed to select, the best way is to keep experimenting, examine the results and then develop from there. We all have our own views on what makes a beautiful image, so as well as taking my advice, go out there and see what works best for you!One thing to remember is to monitor the exposure on your view finder and tweak settings when needed. The beauty of digital photography is that you can see a shot right after you’ve taken it! Don’t like the shots you’re creating? Take them again and again until you’re happy.Try a higher ISOEven though this is a somewhat complicated way to combat the troubles of low light, tinkering with the ISO settings can help you reach the results you’re aiming for. Setting the ISO yourself will give you more control over how your shots look. Even so, it may be better to try adjusting your aperture and shutter speed before meddling with the ISO settings.You could try and combine black and white shots with a higher ISO to give a more vintage feel to your photos; just as beautiful as vibrant and colourful images. I love seeing how photographers portray emotions and stories without relying on colour. In black and white photography you need to only focus on the light you have available and the unique shapes that can be made with various shades of black, grey and white.Now you know how to take stunning photos in any level of light, you can get out there and put your knowledge to the test. If you feel as though you want to look deeper into the potential of low light photography, why not join me on an evening photography workshop in March or April in Kenilworth? I look forward to seeing your skills grow and develop.photography-tips Alan Ranger 3 January 2023long-exposure LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 day+...&media=https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5013f4b2c4aaa4752ac69b17/1579076892798-1QI3WJQE4UUXFM0G34IU/-Alan-Ranger-Photography.jpg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alanranger.com%2Fblog-on-photography%2Fshooting-in-low-light]",

Thankfully we were free to go out again after several lockdowns and then it became a question of getting existing clients to be remotivated to pick this up again and continue.Some haven’t continued post-pandemic, which I understand, as life was changed forever with so much disruption and a rebalancing of priorities for everyone.Janice has always been a fun client to have on workshops and events. She is always keen to discover compositions, techniques and thinking patterns with her approach to image-making. She generally gives me a hard time with her banter, and that’s also fine, as I am always willing to give twice as much back 😊You will see from her final panel of images a great variation in technique, subject matter, the skilful use of perspective and exposure settings to place you at the moment, and the feeling of the place or subject.

Empathy for the subject is always a vital part of the skills needed to demonstrate a successful panel. The RPS assessors don’t always get it right but generally look for photographer input, awareness, communication and technical execution.Well done, Janice, a bit too long getting to this milestone, but I hope you will be motivated now to continue the journey and look to start creating bodies of work for an A panel and your own satisfaction.The assessors also commented on Janice’s panel for her paper choice for the printing, done by One Vision Imaging Ltd , who supported her with several test prints before the final panel production.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JANICE ON FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?It seemed the next natural step. I’m best motivated by having a project so this was ideal for me. It was also a way for me to understand and focus on areas in which I needed to improve.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING COURSE?I first met Alan at a Get Off Auto workshop in around 2014 and was hooked from the first session. I attended many workshops across a whole range of subjects with Alan together with various day and residential workshops and, therefore, there was never any question that I would choose and trust Alan to mentor me in order to get to the next level. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING CLASSES. I can’t really fault the format of the mentoring classes as they are restricted to a small group of participants which means that Alan is able to give each participant the right amount of time. Being able to listen to Alan’s critique and advice to the other participants is also really useful. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes, I found it helpful that Alan gives you some flexibility to work at your own pace within the framework of lessons. There is also the support and understanding from others in the group that is sharing the experience. For me, this extended outside of the workshops with shared trips to locations and events to help us fill the gaps in our portfolios. 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? Personally, I didn’t think I was good enough, but Alan suggested it was the next step and I trusted his judgment. The mentoring course was challenging for me, but Alan’s feedback and critique certainly helped me improve. In hindsight, I learned a great deal from the experience. The mentoring course certainly gave me a focus and has made me think differently about the creative side of photography.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?I applied for the L and was successful. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I attended the assessment day on Zoom as I couldn’t make the trip to Bristol. Luckily I was first on, so I didn’t have to wait long in my “calmly stressed” state. I was pleasantly surprised at the positive feedback I had from the assessors, and it has certainly given me m OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I attended the assessment day on Zoom as I couldn’t make the trip to Bristol. Luckily I was first on, so I didn’t have to wait long in my “calmly stressed” state. I was pleasantly surprised at the positive feedback I had from the assessors, and it has certainly given me more confidence in my ability.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I booked a 1:1 with an RPS assessor to review my draft panel. This was invaluable as it gave an insight into what the assessors would be looking for. The advice given certainly helped me refine the panel layout and images to bring it up to the required standard 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?Use the checklist provided by Alan, which helps you review the images you have and highlights the gaps you need to fill. Also, having taken part in an assessment day, my advice would be to have your panel critiqued by an RPS assessor before submission to give you the best chance of being successful. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?Staying motivated and also processing images to the required standard. Sometimes having to go back and start processing again. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Yes, it taught me a lot about composition and camera technique. It also helped me improve my processing skills in Lightroom. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD?I would never have achieved a distinction without Alan’s support, patience and perseverance, so thank you. Having watched a live assessment made me realise that his attention to detail and critique is absolutely necessary and gave me the best chance of success.----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Courses for distinct RN0D/_-8.jpg]View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Courses for distinctions RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * ZOOM - ONLINE * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

However, with fireworks being so fast and short, it can be difficult to take the perfect shot if you don't know what you're doing.So, here are my tips for successful Photographing FireworksSCOUT OUT THE AREAKnow you’re environment. Where will be the best place to take shots from? What angle will be best? Where can you shoot so people don't get in the way? Preparing early is the best way to ensure you get successful shots instead of mediocre ones.It also helps to get there 1-2 hours early to make sure your preferred spot hasn't been taken by the general public or other photographers. Being upwind from where the fireworks are being set off is also advantageous to avoid being smoked out.USE A TRIPODThere’s nothing worse than thinking you've captured the perfect shot only to find that you were moving too much, making the photo blurry and distorted. By using a tripod you can avoid this disappointment and focus more on where you’ll be shooting.Having a remote release for your camera can also be useful in keeping your tripod steady during shoots. Timers can be a little trickier as you ere moving too much, making the photo blurry and distorted. By using a tripod you can avoid this disappointment and focus more on where you’ll be shooting.Having a remote release for your camera can also be useful in keeping your tripod steady during shoots. Timers can be a little trickier as you have to time the shots further in advance. Still, practice makes perfect!TURN OFF YOUR FLASHThere’s no need for the flash on your camera. If anything, it'll make your photos worse. Set it to manual mode so you can control the aperture and exposure yourself. Don't let the camera decide what’s best as most cameras can’t handle working in limited light.Take control and make the perfect photos yourself!SIZE YOUR FRAME WELLRemember that when fireworks explode, they spread out in all directions, so you need to anticipate how far they'll spread. Of course, this is trial and error, so don't worry too much if you miss the first few shots, as you’re getting used to the spread of the fireworks.Perhaps try both vertical and horizontal arrangements so you can take various shots.REVIEW YOUR SHUTTER SPEEDSSetting your shutter speed to bulb (or ‘b’) is advisable as there is no time set for the exposure and you can open and close manually when you feel you've captured enough bursts in one shot. You shouldn't keep the shutter open for too long as you can overexpose your shot, resulting in a blur of light and colour.A lot of photographers suggest is with the bulb or ‘b’ setting is that you should open the shutter as soon as you're either hear or see the firework shoot into the air and leave it open until the firework begins to fade.EXPERIMENTDon't let these rules tie you down. The best part about photography is experimenting and seeing what works best for you. Discovering what works and what doesn't is part of the fun so get out there and test your camera skills!Are you going to any fireworks displays this winter or planning to test yourself? I’d love to see the photos you take and I'm willing to answer any questions you might have.My workshop at Kenilworth Fireworks Display is sell out quickly, so don't miss out next time, book yourself for next years workshop today and learn the secrets to getting professional looking firework images. http://www.alanranger.com/photographic-workshops/kenilworth-fireworks-25hrs Have fun this winter and get shooting!photography-tips Alan Ranger 0 Tumblr 0 Likes",

Sign up here if you want to receive these by email Hopefully, with more downtime, you will be able to read and learn photography basics or refresh your understanding. This one is not sixty seconds read :)----------------------------------------PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS - TEN THINGS I WISH I KNEW EARLIER ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHYAfter twenty years of being passionate about photography, I'd like to think I have learned a few things on the way so wanted to share some of those lightbulb moments I had in the early days that helped me improve my photographs. This list could have easily been twenty or forty items, but I wanted to try and condense it into what I think were the most critical elements that I realised back in the day when I began. Some of the items are of course technical, and it's only right that any beginner has to learn those elements to do with the camera and settings, but also some of the significant changes were based on softer skills about light, composition and treatment of photos in post-production. I hope they help or at least remind you of the essential lessons that you are learning now or have learnt----------------------------------------FREE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS #01 GET OFF AUTOMATIC MODELEARN TO SHOOT IN APERTURE OR SHUTTER PRIORITY MODE TO CONTROL DEPTH OF FIELD AND FOCUS AND SHUTTER SPEED TO CAPT or at least remind you of the essential lessons that you are learning now or have learnt----------------------------------------FREE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS #01 GET OFF AUTOMATIC MODELEARN TO SHOOT IN APERTURE OR SHUTTER PRIORITY MODE TO CONTROL DEPTH OF FIELD AND FOCUS AND SHUTTER SPEED TO CAPTURE MOVEMENT THE WAY YOU WANT TO. MAKING YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND MISTAKES IS THE FASTEST WAY TO REALISING WHAT THOSE NUMBERS AND SETTINGS REALLY MEAN AND HOW THEY CHANGE AN IMAGE.#02 CONTROL YOUR DEPTH OF FIELDUNDERSTANDING AND USING APERTURE TO CONTROL THE DEPTH OF FIELD (AMOUNT OF SUBJECT MATTER IN FOCUS OR BLURRED) WAS A TURNING POINT FOR ME. BEING ABLE TO VARY THAT AT WILL TO CREATE SOFT AND DELICATE REPRESENTATIONS OR AS MUCH DETAIL AS I WANTED WAS A GAME-CHANGER. YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE IT HARDER THAN IT TECHNICALLY NEEDS TO BE. APERTURE PRIORITY WILL ALLOW THE CAMERAS LIGHT METER TO WORK OUT EXPOSURE WHILE YOU CONTROL THE DEPTH OF FIELD. MANUAL EXPOSURE WORKS TOO, BUT IT WILL TAKE YOU LONGER TO ACHIEVE THE SAME THING.#03 UNDERSTAND AND USE THE HISTOGRAMTHE HISTOGRAM IS A SIMPLE GRAPH YOU CAN USE WHEN VIEWING A PHOTO ON THE BACK OF THE CAMERAS LCD. IT WILL SHOW YOU WHERE TONAL VALUES OF LIGHT ARE DISTRIBUTED IN THE PICTURE. SHADOW PIXELS TO THE LEFT, MID-TONES IN THE MIDDLE AND HIGHLIGHTS TO THE RIGHT. LEARNING TO EXPOSE TO THE RIGHT (ETR) IS ESSENTIAL IF YOU DON'T WANT \"NOISE\" IN THE SHADOWS. YOUR PHOTO MAY LOOK \"WASHED OUT\" AS A RESULT, BUT THIS IS EASILY CORRECTED IN POST-PRODUCTION AND WILL PRODUCE MUCH BETTER TONAL QUALITY AND RESOLUTION IN THE FINAL IMAGE.#04 UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHERE TO FOCUS ACCURATELYIS FOCUSING SIMPLE? WELL, YES TO AN EXTENT BUT, IT'S SURPRISING HOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHERE TO FOCUS IN A SHOT. SOME APPS CAN HELP YOU DETERMINE HYPER FOCAL DISTANCE, BUT PERSONALLY, THE IDEA OF GETTING AN APP OUT ON MY PHONE DURING A CREATIVE MOMENT FILLS ME WITH DREAD. LEARN TO CONTROL YOUR FOCUS POINT SELECTIVELY AND WHERE TO FOCUS IN A SCENE TO RENDER THE DEPTH OF FIELD YOU REQUIRE. REMEMBER THERE IS MORE THAN ONE VARIABLE TO FOCUSING TO ACHIEVE FOCUS AND DOF!#05 SIMPLIFY YOUR COMPOSITIONTHIS WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THOSE TURNING POINTS WHEN IT CAME TO COMPOSITION. LESS IS MORE! IT'S MORE IMPORTANT WHAT YOU CUT OUT OF A FRAME THAN PUT IN THE FRAME. SIMPLIFY THE COMPOSITION DOWN TO THE THINGS THAT ONLY MATTER RATHER THAN TRYING TO CAPTURE EVERYTHING AND OVER-COMPLICATING THE COMPOSITION AND THE CAMERAS LIMITED EXPOSURE RANGE. WORK ON BALANCING YOUR FRAME WITH ELEMENTS (HIGHLIGHTS, MID-TONES, SHADOWS) RATHER THAN TRYING TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING. REMEMBER, YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE MORE THAN ONE SHOT!#06 WHY ARE YOU STANDING THERE?THIS ONE TOOK ME A WHILE TO GRASP AND IMPROVE ON. NOW, IT'S ODD HOW CLIENTS SAY YOU ALWAYS GRAB THE BEST SPOTS. I DON'T AS IT HAPPENS, I ALLOW THEM TO FIND THEIR POSITIONS AND THEN WORK AROUND THEM. MAYBE, IT HAS BECOME INTUITIVE TO ME NOW, I SHOULD HOPE SO AFTER TWENTY YEARS, BUT MERELY OBSERVING THE SCENE, AND ADJUSTING HEIGHT (LOWER OR HIGHER, LEFT OR RIGHT), PERSPECTIVE, ANGLES PLUS FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND WILL AMAZE YOU HOW IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND BETTER PHOTOGRAPH. GET AGILE AND BE PREPARED TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU STAND AND HOW MOVING MAY IMPROVE THINGS.#07 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE LIGHTWHEN I FIRST STARTED PHOTOGRAPHY, I DIDN'T PROPERLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO READ LIGHT IN A SCENE. SURE, I COULD SPOT A GOOD SUNRISE OR SUNSE NCE AND BETTER PHOTOGRAPH. GET AGILE AND BE PREPARED TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU STAND AND HOW MOVING MAY IMPROVE THINGS.#07 IT'S ALL ABOUT THE LIGHTWHEN I FIRST STARTED PHOTOGRAPHY, I DIDN'T PROPERLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO READ LIGHT IN A SCENE. SURE, I COULD SPOT A GOOD SUNRISE OR SUNSET, BUT OUTSIDE OF THE OBVIOUS, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOW THE CAMERA READS LIGHT AND MY EYES/BRAIN RECORD IT. THEY ARE DIFFERENT! I GOT FRUSTRATED THAT MY IMAGES OF LOCATIONS DIDN'T MATCH THOSE OF OTHERS I VIEWED. I WORKED OUT THAT MANAGING THE LIGHT WITH FILTERS, BRACKETING, SHOOTING DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE LIGHT AND HOW IT RENDERED THINGS IN THE IMAGE WAS A HUGE EYE-OPENER. PHOTOGRAPHY IS ALL ABOUT LIGHT AND HOW THE CAMERA RECORDS THOSE PHOTONS. LEARN ABOUT LIGHT, EMBRACE ITS MANY FORMS AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT LIGHTING.#08 POST-PROCESSING IS NOT CHEATINGI REMEMBER THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP I ATTENDED AND HAVING A PASSIONATE DEBATE ABOUT HOW DOING SOMETHING TO AN IMAGE ON THE COMPUTER AFTERWARDS WAS NOT AUTHENTIC! HOW LITTLE I UNDERSTOOD BACK THEN. PHOTO EDITING, PROCESSING, MANIPULATION WHATEVER YOU CALL IT HAS BEEN PART OF THE PHOTOGRAPHY WORKFLOW SINCE ITS CONCEPTION. WHETHER YOU ALLOW YOUR CAMERA TO DO THE GENERIC STYLING OR YOU DO YOUR OWN THING IS YOUR CHOICE BUT REMEMBER THE CAMERA IS JUST AN INSTRUMENT, HOW YOU PLAY IT AND THE STYLE YOU PLAY IT IN IS YOUR CHOICE – AND RIGHTLY SO! LEARN HOW TO EDIT YOUR PHOTOS TO THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO LOOK. THAT MEANS TAKING CONTROL, LEARNING HOW TO USE EDITING SOFTWARE AND BECOMING PROFICIENT AT THE JOB.#09 DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELFI KNOW WE ARE ALL OUR OWN WORSE CRITICS. I INCLUDED, BUT REMEMBER WE ALL HAVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES SO WE HAVE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND IMPORTANTLY, WHAT AREAS WILL GIVE US THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GAINS. GOING BACK TO MY CORPORATE DAYS AS A CONSULTANT, I RECALL DISCUSSING THIS TOPIC AND WORKING OUT WHETHER IT WAS RIGHT TO PLAY TO SOMEONE'S STRENGTHS OR WORK ON IMPROVING THEIR WEAKNESSES. IN PRACTICE, IT IS A CASE OF BALANCING THE TWO BUT EMPHASISING THEIR STRENGTHS MORE SO THAT THEY DIDN'T LOSE MOTIVATION. WHEN IT COMES TO APPLYING THAT TO YOUR PHOTOGRAPHY, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK BACK AT WHERE YOU STARTED AND WHERE YOU ARE NOW AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROGRESS YOU HAVE MADE OVER SOME TIME. IF YOU GET IN A RUT (I'VE HAD SEVERAL OVER THE YEARS) THEN IT'S TIME TO TAKE A FRESH APPROACH BUT STAYING DETERMINED AND OPEN-MINDED WILL YIELD RESULTS IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO TAKE ON BOARD THE FEEDBACK AND WORK HARD TO GET BETTER.#10 GO OUT AND TAKE MORE PHOTOSA NICE EASY ONE TO FINISH ON. YOU WILL MISS 100% OF THE SHOTS YOU DIDN'T TAKE! THE MORE YOU PRACTICE, THE MORE YOU TAKE (CONSIDERED WISE), THE MORE YOU FAMILIARISE YOURSELF WITH THE CAMERA, SETTINGS, COMPOSITION, LIGHT, AND WHAT WORKS AND DOESN'T. YOU WOULDN'T EXPECT TO GO TO THE GYM ONCE AND LOSE 1KG OR PICK UP A GUITAR EVERY EIGHT WEEKS AND STRUM AND EXPECT TO PLAY LIKE JIMI HENDRIX SO WHY THINK THAT PHOTOGRAPHY IS ANY DIFFERENT. GOING OUT AND \"MAKING\" RATHER THAN TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS WITH CRITICAL THINKING IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET BETTER.

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - KIRSTEN PEARCE - LRPS | RPS DISTINCTIONSView fullsizeKIRSTEN HAS BEEN A REGULAR CLIENT AT MY EVENTS FOR SOME YEARS, SO IT WAS FITTING THAT SHE DECIDED TO TAKE THAT STEP OF GAINING A RPS DISTINCTIONS THROUGH MY MENTORING SCHEME.When Kirsten first signed up for the RPS classes, she (under my influence) embarked on the Associate level and steadily built up a panel of water abstracts. However, after initial feedback from an RPS 1-2-1 and much deliberation, she switched to attaining the Licentiate.Kirsten is a photographer with a natural eye, and her images are generally on the creative and abstract side rather than literal, so doing the L was, in some ways, a challenge. Stepping away from a single-themed panel to demonstrate diversity in technique, lighting, and genre requires a broad range of images from your back portfolio that can work together. In fact, the overall panel layout is often referred to as the 11th image.Kirsten’s journey to this achievement was delayed because of the initial false start and then Covid-19 restrictions, so I was delighted when she returned to complete this project earlier this year. Kirsten has demonstrated through her images that she can competently use the camera across a wide range of situations, from freezing action in 2, 3 and 9 to more abstract use in colour, shape and texture in 4, 5 and 7 and using light and mood in 1 and 8 to depict emotion in her landscapes.The assessors also commented on Kirsten’s panel for that she can competently use the camera across a wide range of situations, from freezing action in 2, 3 and 9 to more abstract use in colour, shape and texture in 4, 5 and 7 and using light and mood in 1 and 8 to depict emotion in her landscapes.The assessors also commented on Kirsten’s panel for her paper choice for the printing, done by One Vision Imaging Ltd , who supported her with several test prints before the final panel production. Congratulations Kirsten; long overdue and well earned. It gives me so much pride to have seen you gain this achievement, and I hope you will be spurred on to enjoy your creative image-making with an eye on the Associate distinction soon.You can follow Kirsten on Instagram to see more of her creative images. https://www.instagram.com/kirstennpearce/ ----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH KIRSTEN GOING FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?A question I asked myself many times! I’d made the commitment to develop my skills in photography. It is a recognised international qualification and was a standard to aim for and to challenge myself to reach.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS MENTORING COURSE?I completed Alan’s beginner’s course in 2014 as my first step in photography. Since then I have taken part in mentoring, many workshops and the intentions course. Alan was therefore the natural choice of mentor. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. The classes were really helpful in learning what made a good panel. Alan’s honest feedback and high standards gave me confidence that I was as prepared as I could be when I got to the assessment stage. It was a supportive way of working, good to learn from people on the same journey and to help and support each other. This extended outside of the classes with shared photo trips to look for images to fill any gaps. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Definitely. Getting 10 images together that not only work individually, but also as a panel is challenging. Lots of images were rejected along the way. Alan’s constructive criticism as well as the many hints and tips that I picked up from the course have really helped me to develop as a photographer. 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? I trusted Alan’s opinion that it was achievable. Completing the LRPS was a good choice and has given me the confidence that I have achieved a benchmark that I can move on from. Now I’ve finished the qualification I’m looking forward to developing the areas of photography that I enjoy and not worrying about whether what I’m taking will work in a panel!6. WHAT RPS DISTINCTIONS DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?I gained the LRPS. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS DISTINCTIONS ASSESSMENT DAY?Daunting! I wanted to attend in person as I’d heard from others about their experiences of the day. It turned out that audiences haven’t really returned in numbers post covid and I was the only observer there. Fortunately I was successful, otherwise it would have been very awkward! The staff there were very welcoming and after my assessment had been completed I had the opportuni iences of the day. It turned out that audiences haven’t really returned in numbers post covid and I was the only observer there. Fortunately I was successful, otherwise it would have been very awkward! The staff there were very welcoming and after my assessment had been completed I had the opportunity to talk to the assessors who were very encouraging. I’m glad I went as it was good to be there in person to listen to their comments during my assessment, it made the experience feel more complete than it would have by staying at home.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I signed up for a one2one with the RPS once my draft panel of 10 with 5 spares was ready. This was by zoom and with a volunteer that is sometimes a panel member. The second opinion gained by someone looking at the images with a fresh pair of eyes was really helpful. He made a number of suggestions that helped to refine my final panel. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?I’d definitely recommend getting your images printed rather than doing the digital assessment. I felt that learning about the printing process and having something physical at the end made everything feel more complete. I had my images printed at One Vision and Adam and the team there were incredibly supportive and helpful. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?Staying motivated. I had a few false starts before getting to this point and it would have been very easy to give up. I can’t begin to imagine how many images were rejected before getting to the final 10 11. HAS WORKING FOR A RPS DISTINCTIONS HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?I’ve learnt a lot from camera craft to composition to processing to forming a coherent panel showing a range of techniques. There’s still lots to learn but it has definitely made me a better photographer. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.Many thanks to Alan for all of his time, support and encouragement throughout the journey and particularly over the last few months.

I will provide the photographic critique for those enrolled on the six-assignment course starting 1st Sep 2022 and ending 1st Dec 2022. There are limited places left so if you fancy trying your hand at creating a short poem to overlay onto your own photograph, don’t delay.Course Description: Shahai is a less familiar term than haiga – the traditional pairing of a haiku with a picture. Shahai is a haiga where the picture is a photographic image.There are different ways and styles of making shahai, and in this course we concentrate on landscape photography, with the poems added onto the picture, or under it, in graphic text. It's a longer shahai course than we have run before, and that is because the aim is to make a small portfolio of six pieces of work. There is an optional pre-assignment to help guide you in making choices about how your work will come together.Format: Participants submit a shahai every two weeks. These are added to a dedicated online galle n before, and that is because the aim is to make a small portfolio of six pieces of work. There is an optional pre-assignment to help guide you in making choices about how your work will come together.Format: Participants submit a shahai every two weeks. These are added to a dedicated online gallery, which is private to the course participants, where the poetry tutor and the photography tutor will add feedback notes in the intervening weeks. We will have an informal review at the end of the course, where participants can re-upload their work to show each other changes that they might have made after the feedback.More Course Information Marcie Wessels Shahai from the last course.news Alan Ranger 18 August 2022Alan Ranger Photography news LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERS TO LEARN AND PRACTICEPHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSIn recognition of beginners, and remembering my own start into digital cameras and photography, I wanted to share some of my own insights from fifteen years.I have been conflicted in my thoughts about this post for over a week, so have been mulling things over, trying to work out why it’s been a tug of war between what I know now compared to what I found helpful in my own photographic journey. Therefore should I be sharing ten or whatever number of insights that reflect where I draw my inspiration and approach from now or what number of things helped me arrive at where I am now?On reflection I think they are two different things, intrinsically connected but separated by the level and experience of the recipient. So I have decided to write two separate posts; one for the beginner and for the intermediate photographer.The post for the intermediate photographer will follow soon and will seem contradictory to the five insights I have outlined here. They are only contradictory because photography, as an art form at least, is a transformational process and could be compared to the the analogy of “you need to walk before you can run” to explain this evolutionary process. Only by building on existing knowledge and experience is it possible, in my opinion, to practice the latter.The second post will attempt to deal with being the servant to dissatisfaction, that we are wired t he analogy of “you need to walk before you can run” to explain this evolutionary process. Only by building on existing knowledge and experience is it possible, in my opinion, to practice the latter.The second post will attempt to deal with being the servant to dissatisfaction, that we are wired to feel as human beings, and how your approach (mindfulness) to photography can make you the master of satisfaction and allow the creativity to blossom.I don’t want to falsely promise that doing these things will make you a professional photographer or mean that you are “successful”, if you measure success in likes, awards, sales or some other form of accolades, but measure it in personal advancement and honest self assessment of the achievements and progress you have made in learning the fundamentals. I recently blogged about How to Learn Photography and why I believe that your attitude to photography counts for more than your innate capability. This post is focused very much on improving your capability and the next post your attitude towards your photography. Combined your overall performance (performance = satisfaction) should improve.Please note, this is not intended to be a ten or five step guide to learning about shutter speeds, aperture and ISO, or telling you that all you need to do is attend a photography course, or photography workshop. This post is about how you might tap into a range of resources and exercises to maximise your efforts, to produce outputs that you feel are better over time.These are things that I did over fifteen years to try and improve my capability, and how I created images and enjoyed photography more.SET YOURSELF SOME TARGETS: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSTargets sounds very corporate but they don’t have to be! The idea of setting goals in life is, simply, to give you a target to aim for. You may full short or exceed the target but nonetheless it, at least, provides a benchmark and motivation for you to measure against and strive to meet.In photography terms, it maybe means one single thing or a number of things; 1. To become less confused, and more proficient about basic camera settings and how, why and when to use those settings to capture the photo you want. 2. To improve your understanding of photographic composition, so that you frame shots that show a greater intention and skill of connecting to your subject. 3. To travel and record images of the places and experiences you have with a better result than just a snap or disappointing photo that doesn’t justify what you saw and felt. 4. To receive recognition in camera club or other competitions for single images. 5. To achieve a recognised standard through a professional or amateur body with a photography accreditation or qualification. 6. To create a body of work, portfolio or develop a style of photography that expresses the way you interpret your subjects and use photography to tell a story.The list goes on, and there are no right or wrong answers to this question and ambition. What is important, in my view, is that you have some goals. The goals may change throughout the year(s) and adapt, but having a clear vision of want you want to achieve in any given time period, will help you focus, be motivated and measure your progress.RESEARCH, REVIEW AND REVISIT: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSResearching a locations terrain and access, reviewing your imag ghout the year(s) and adapt, but having a clear vision of want you want to achieve in any given time period, will help you focus, be motivated and measure your progress.RESEARCH, REVIEW AND REVISIT: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSResearching a locations terrain and access, reviewing your images, and from others, for a location, and revisiting a location multiple times, are sure ways to improve your chance of getting better shots and a variety of shots in different light and conditions.As an outdoor photography workshop host, this is default practise and every workshop location is thoroughly researched beforehand. Of course, this is one of the main advantages of going on an organised workshop to a location. You spend less time working out the logistics and burning energy on finding the right areas and more time enjoying and learning photography.MAKE PHOTOGRAPHY A HABIT: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSIf you signed up for a gym membership, but didn’t go, you wouldn’t expect to get fitter. In fact, the only pounds you would lose would be from your bank account rather than waistline. Photography is no different, you have to put in the effort on a frequent basis to exercise the muscle.Set aside time, even if just an hour, on a weekly basis to do photography. Doing photography doesn’t have to involve going out with the camera. It can be taking photos indoors, editing photos, reading articles or a book, “reading” (to read a photo we decode the photograph, unpacking the photographer's interpretation rather than accepting the photograph as it …) and learn from it. Anything that helps build your understanding and increases your capability will help to pay dividends further down the line. If you have a friend who also enjoys photography, why not schedule something on a regular basis together?LEARN HOW TO POST PROCESS WITH SKILL AND SENSITIVITY: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSThis is important. When I started using a digital camera, I naively thought that the end of the photographic process was the click of the shutter and then look at the resulting photo on the memory card on the computer. Sure, I was comfortable with cropping the image if I felt it improved the overall composition and maybe even straightening the odd wonky horizon.But, I didn’t have the understanding or knowledge to do anything further. The thought of using photoshop or similar software was an alien concept to me and one I didn’t feel was an authentic form of photography. It didn’t take long before I realised that every photograph was a lie.Forgetting the fact that shooting in JPG format meant the image was being processed anyway, by the cameras JPG preset settings, the mere fact we turn a three dimensional world into a shrunken two dimensional view and only show a portion of a scene in a rectangular frame clearly is clearly not reality.Pablo Picasso was alleged to have said, when painting a portrait of a man's wife and the husband became increasingly agitated, Picasso enquired why he was so concerned. The husband replied that the painting looked nothing his wife. Picasso replied, “So, tell me, what does your wife look like?” The man took a picture out of his wallet and said “that’s how she looks!” Picasso carefully studied the picture and said, “oh really! Small, isn’t she?”A photograph is constructed by the photographer, aided by additional enhancement in the digital dark room, and reconstructed by the viewer with subjective judge picture out of his wallet and said “that’s how she looks!” Picasso carefully studied the picture and said, “oh really! Small, isn’t she?”A photograph is constructed by the photographer, aided by additional enhancement in the digital dark room, and reconstructed by the viewer with subjective judgement.Just like cooking a meal, you start with raw ingredients and then combine, flavour add additional herbs and spices and cook it the way it suits your palate. Whether that also agrees with another person's palate should not restrict or constrain the way you want to serve it.Be aware of over-sharpening, bringing out too much detail in areas of the photograph that don’t require detail and trying to achieve the maximum impact through clumsy and an insensitive appreciation of the scene. I witness a lot of photos that scream of too much saturation, too much definition and so on that become a distraction of what the photographer witnessed and experienced. It is akin to pouring half a jar of vindaloo curry powder into one dish when a teaspoon full was more than enough for anyone’s palate.INVEST WISELY IN YOUR CRAFT: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSIf you read photography magazines, go to a camera club or just look at Youtube and social media photography posts you will find that the majority of conversation and explanation is focused around the gear. Of course the camera, lens and accessories will make a difference to the way you photograph or more importantly how much easier or difficult it is to take pictures. But, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the gear is the master and therefore you become the slave. Or, to put it another way, the gear produces the photograph rather than the photographer.People will naturally be drawn to better lenses, camera bodies and the accessories that are marketed and almost religiously preached as being the answer to the problem that many beginners ask the reason why and how… However, from my own personal experience and that of tutoring literally thousands of beginners the gear is not the shortfall the reason they are not making photographs that satisfy.It may be an “obvious” and an easy conclusion to make that the reason a particular photographer is deemed good is due to the fact that they have x,y,z gear. Trust me, I have met many photographers with all the gear and no idea, and plenty of beginners with lots of ideas and no gear. Ideas, means an understanding, appreciation and creative perspective and they can find a way of creating something from nothing, with whatever they have at their disposal. Yes, the result may have room for improvement with a better lens, better resolution or the use of a filter or two, but what separates them from the former is knowledge and the ability to adapt with what they have at their disposal.That knowledge is acquired through the hard hours put into learning their camera craft and being able to see beyond the media generated views of what is reality or beautiful to see the extraordinary in the everyday objects, scenes and events in our lives.Education and knowledge has a bigger positive outcome on your photography than a new lens, tripod, upgraded camera body or the latest accessories and gizmos.Invest in learning the craft more than you do on the equipment to execute it.When you search for photography courses and workshops you will find a plethora of options to choose from. Many people book based on price, location and date. This is of course inevi or the latest accessories and gizmos.Invest in learning the craft more than you do on the equipment to execute it.When you search for photography courses and workshops you will find a plethora of options to choose from. Many people book based on price, location and date. This is of course inevitable, we all live busy lives and have to make compromises, decisions based on multiple criteria. However, how many people use the criteria of education and development before location, budget and dates? I hazard to guess but suspect it’s at least 80%Good photographers don’t necessarily make good teachers. Vice versa, good teachers don’t make necessarily make good photographers. Good is obviously subjective, but you should, at very least, put the emphasis on good teachers before good photographers when choosing a course or workshop if you actually want to learn and improve rather than just imitate.SHOOT WHAT YOU CONNECT TO AND EXPERIMENT: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSI have emphasised this point on countless occasions over the last ten years - without a personal connection to the subject, scene, situation it’s impossible to create an image, captured in single moment, that expresses what one truly feels about what they are experiencing.This intention is critical for the photographer to know and arguably important for the viewer to interpret.When I embarked on learning photography, I didn’t have a clear idea about what I wanted to photograph. My only objective was that I wanted to become better at whatever I photographed. I therefore experimented with many genres, travel, landscapes, wildlife, portraits, architecture and events. Over time it became apparent that I was naturally drawn to one genre over the over. Maybe it’s because I am most relaxed and used the outdoors and landscape environments both locally and further afield to re-balance myself after a hectic, stressful and exhausting week in the corporate world I worked in. The outdoors and particularly the countryside has always been a major part of recreation for me so it’s of no real surprise that my photography pursuits ended up taking place there. While I do think it’s important for any photographer, especially beginners, to experiment with other genres and subjects - this helps build a visual awareness, understanding and increases the repertoire of knowledge, I certainly found that my “best” (measured in personal satisfaction) came from my outdoor/landscape images.Focus your efforts on the genre you enjoy most and have easy access to but don’t be afraid to experiment and dabble in other genres too.YOUR BEST IMAGE DOESN’T DEFINE YOUR VISION OR ABILITY: PHOTOGRAPHY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERSThere is a real danger that we self-doubt our images and rely on some for of external feedback for confirmation, reassurance or measurement of our best work. The photography community itself has an abundance of ways, when it comes to these checks and balances with competitions, accreditations, awards or simply the size of your Instagram or Facebook following and likes. Being popular doesn’t necessarily mean you are good - Van Gogh only sold one of his own paintings in his whole lifetime - on this basis he really wasn’t very good at what he did!I have met many people who are part of that slightly-outdated community of camera clubs and societies, who have openly told me that they just want to get placed or highly commended for an image they submit to that internal competit",

      "articleBody": "EXPRESSIVE PHOTOGRAPHY-HARD, OFTEN FRUSTRATING BUT REWARDINGEXPRESSIVE PHOTOGRAPHYI meet many clients who share the desire to create \"expressive\" images. I guess for any landscape/outdoor photographer; it's the panacea to being able to express what they see and feel inside a small rectangular frame. Of course, we see and feel much more than what we distil into that frame which is why we choose what we want to include and exclude, and it often becomes a personal battle between brain and heart.Blindly following all the rules of photography composition is bound to produce a \"well-crafted\" image and one that may become predictable. Understanding and applying the principles of the rules we learn but adapting them to any given situation is a much more complex challenge and one I enjoy teaching in the broadest sense of the verb. It's in the broad sense of the word because I don't want to tell or teach someone to shoot what I see and feel about a scene and subject and for them to make a composition based on my interpretation. I strive to help them create the best frame they can in the camera to take away to work on.This brings me to another stage of the photographic process. Before I do that, let's remind ourselves about some of the critical elements of a visceral image that creates that feeling of expression rather than recording and documenting just how something looks. As experienced photographers, we have learned how to recognise the play of light, the differences be efore I do that, let's remind ourselves about some of the critical elements of a visceral image that creates that feeling of expression rather than recording and documenting just how something looks. As experienced photographers, we have learned how to recognise the play of light, the differences between shadows, mid-tones and highlights in a scene, the relationships between textures and colours, shapes and direction of flow in a frame, and the overall atmosphere sensed and created by how we frame the image.When it comes to the basic elements of composition and framing close up on details I don’t struggle most of the time and this approach to simplifying everything is relatively easy and generally pleasing. View fullsizeAnglesey - SeaweedView fullsizeAnglesey Rock FormationEXPRESSIVE PHOTOGRAPHYWe are not often conscious of the emotions and feelings that draw us to certain scenes (beyond the reactive obvious) that subconsciously we connect to without giving much thought. They manifest themselves through post-production to produce a final image that we quickly blast onto social media. If that's not your thing, they are confined to the \"finished\" images folder, only to see the light of day for some other random purpose.I did precisely that following my last workshop, quickly processing images I could use to put on IG and occasionally FB but not having an emotional attachment to most of them. It felt like \"On another photography workshop, another set of images created hurridly between supporting clients and being available as much as they wanted me to be.\"Unfortunately for everyone, the final day was the worst weather and often light conditions. The standard shots across the island were not achievable with a spray like rain in the wind blowing straight towards lenses. Fortunately for me, the clients were pretty experienced and, on the last day, were more than happy to work independently as we visited our final location. It provided me with a small window to explore the wooded area and route back to the car park rather than the usual exposed long beach walk back. As those that know me will confirm, I am at my happiest when and, probably naturally connected, when I am in woodlands and forests. As I meandered along the well-trodden route back to the car park, my head was permanently cocked to the left, where the deep pine forest mirrored glimpses of light and atmosphere with intriguing vistas and changes in colour and density. I was fascinated by the trees and how the light passed between them onto the forest floor. Unusually for me, I didn't take the tripod, so was able to move freely onto verges to reduce focal distances and frame things as I wanted without feeling restricted by terrain or time.Today, being a bank holiday meant, I had some time to revisit the Lightroom catalogue and relook at images from the last couple of months. The original image, you will see below, didn't make the first pass of photos to edit and publish quickly but I marked it a potential to return to. This one stood out straight away, but I knew instinctively from working images in post-production that it needed some work.It was a challenging image to work with, and it took me some time to work through the many problematic elements of bright foreground highlights and exposure to create the feeling and expression that I felt was in it.Getting back to the topic of this post. Expressive photography is hard, frustrating, but rewarding. It is age to work with, and it took me some time to work through the many problematic elements of bright foreground highlights and exposure to create the feeling and expression that I felt was in it.Getting back to the topic of this post. Expressive photography is hard, frustrating, but rewarding. It is hard because you have to join many dots together when on location, with the camera and finally with post-production. However, when you make an image in frustrating light and conditions and are able to create something more than it appears it’s so rewarding.View fullsizeOriginal out of cameraView fullsizeFinal Image----------------------------------------EXPRESSIVE PHOTOGRAPHYIs my final image authentic? That's for you to apply your definition of authentic to the eye/brain or consider the heart's authenticity. I've always preferred images of the latter; hence I was satisfied that after 30-45 mins, I turned an initially dismissed image into something more personal and expressive. It embodies many personal circumstances; my process of suffering severe pain for months on end and being on stupid amounts of painkillers daily to deal with dental and osteoradionecrosis after-effects on a physical level.Then, the emotional and mental issues of two years of lockdown issues, relationship break-up, loneliness, wondering/considering what I want or can do next, etc. And then, you find out that a dear friend and client (formerly the other way round) has cancer and then surgery too; at the same time, I was waiting for the results of another cancer biopsy result. It's a lot to absorb! I think all of the emotions and thoughts are what we express, whether we choose to make it about \"happy pictures\" or something that reflects the honesty of how we feel deep inside that come through in our images are what makes them meaningful and personal. Ultimately, for me, that's what expressive photography is about. Not rules, techniques, equipment, location, date, time and weather conditions, but does the image convey how you see and feel at that moment in your life. It is your autobiography in pictures for you to disclose or not! For me, the image conveys light and dark the contrast between where we are, where we have been and where we might go. If an image makes you think beyond the literal and into the visceral, then for me, it works, as simple as that.news , a-journey , what's-behind-the-image Alan Ranger 22 June 2022Alan Ranger Photograohy LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "THE CAMERA IS AN INSTRUMENT TO TEACHES PEOPLE HOW TO SEE“THE CAMERA IS AN INSTRUMENT THAT TEACHES PEOPLE HOW TO SEE WITHOUT A CAMERA.”This revealing quote was from American portraitist Dorothea Lange. quoted in: Los Angeles Times (13 Aug. 1978).By Alan Ranger 2006My experience has taught me that it can take a long time for us mere mortals of photography to learn the art of seeing rather than snapping. It's a principle that I try to instill into all my students when helping them to develop their eye for a shot.Over the years the camera has allowed me to not only capture moments but, importantly, recognise the photographic opportunity in the first place. This is not simply a case of applying formulaic rules of composition because the photograph needs to communicate more than just the position of subjects in a frame. For me at least, it absolutely starts with seeing something that catches my eye or I feel would translate well into a photographic format. One of the key elements I think about is of course framing and that generally means simplicity to me - less is often more and in the case of a photograph I find my own preference leans towards images that keep the content and subject unambiguous. Of course the resulting photograph doesn't tell us everything - it can't. However it should in my opinion provide us enough information to connect to it on an emotional level and ask the viewer to look for longer than 3 seconds.Spending more than a few seconds loo ontent and subject unambiguous. Of course the resulting photograph doesn't tell us everything - it can't. However it should in my opinion provide us enough information to connect to it on an emotional level and ask the viewer to look for longer than 3 seconds.Spending more than a few seconds looking at something before you press the shutter will, over time, improve your eye for seeing, feeling and learning how to create a photograph rather than simply taking one. It's an evolving journey and one that fascinates me as I witness how my own eye has evolved over the years - as a result of looking at the world through the camera the world now looks back at me in a different way.PLEASE LIKE AND SHARE THIS POST IF YOU FOUND IT USEFUL USING THE SHARE LINK BELOWphotography-tips Alan Ranger 0 Tumblr 0 Likes",

UPON REVIEWING THAT SUBMISSION, I UNDERSTOOD WHY IT HADN’T MET THE CRITERIA, SO I OFFERED TO HELP HIM CREATE A PANEL OF IMAGES THAT I FELT WOULD BE TO THE STANDARD REQUIRED.I hadn’t anticipated that Max would complete the task with such speed and determination to be awarded his Licentiate distinction just five/six months after his first RPS mentoring class. More amazing is that only two or three images remained in his final panel from the original failed submission.Max used a mixture of group RPS mentoring classes and online 1-2-1 Zoom sessions with me to reach this rapid turnaround. The sessions concentrated on image selection, editing and how to analyse an image and every element in meticulous detail. Max also took my advice about printing, and using a professional print lab to ensure print quality was not a factor. He used One Vision Imaging Ltd , who supported him with the choice of paper and several test prints before the final panel production.Max’s successful panel demonstrates the range of subject matter, technique, perspective and photogr rint quality was not a factor. He used One Vision Imaging Ltd , who supported him with the choice of paper and several test prints before the final panel production.Max’s successful panel demonstrates the range of subject matter, technique, perspective and photographer’s input required to meet the standard of an L with the RPS. The panel layout is balanced with tonality, colour, visual weight and capturing moments. Max has an eye for imagery, whether it be stratospheric with his Astrophotography to the micro of dials inside an engine, and then showing empathy with his portraits and captured moments.Congratulations Max; I was confident you would pass with your new panel, and I look forward to you starting your next steps into developing your photography further with projects on subjects that may take you to your Associate distinction.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH MAX GOING FOR HIS RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?I wanted to improve my general photography and applying for the Licentiate with its clear criteria provided a structured approach and a goal to aim for.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS MENTORING COURSE?I had not worked with Alan before and choose him from a list of candidates from Google. I was looking for someone who was well qualified and who was focused on the RPS distinction pathway. Alan’s claim to get all candidates through the Licentiate was reassuring. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. I used a mixture of classes and individual mentoring. This enabled me to learn from the experience of others but also concentrate on my portfolio. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes, I got from the course exactly what I needed, by building my learning around my images and what they revealed about my strengths and needs for improvement. 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? I contacted Alan after I failed my first assessment with the RPS. I understood why images did not meet the RPS criteria but needed an experienced eye to guide me on how I should improve.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?I applied for the Licentiate and after Alan’s mentoring my images sailed through the assessment. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?The Assessment Day was very successful. The judges gave me lots of positive feedback.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I used my local camera club, but it would not have been reasonable to expect the same time commitment I got from Alan 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?To be successful in the assessment you need to understand the RPS criteria in detail and have the advice of someone who knows what this means in practise 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?It was not hard as long as you listened to exactly what Alan said and put it into practice. 11.

HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?I feel my overall standard has gone up a level from interested amateur to a competent photographer with still much to learn. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.I valued Alans direct style. He told me exactly what I needed to do to get my images to the standard required by the RPS.

      "articleBody": "EXTEND THE LIFE OF YOUR CAMERA | CAMERA CARE GUIDECAMERA CARECamera's are for using, I have often remarked that buying a camera of any type that you leave at home in bubble wrap in fear of taking it out and damaging it, is a pointless procession to own. It isn't just because you won't have it when you need it for that spur of the moment shot, it's because you are more likely to be unfamiliar with it operation, controls and be able to adjust settings quickly enough to make the magic shot.There are of course plenty of things you can do to prolong the life of your treasured camera and ensure it's in full working order for hopefully years to come. Here is my list of top tips to help you extend the life of your camera and do camera care.CAMERA CARE - #001 - INSURE ITMy number 1 tip simply because if insured then you have peace of mind in case of an accident or theft etc. Most household contents policy will cover your camera equipment up to a certain level but there maybe a limit on how much it covers and types of use away from home so check with them and make sure you cover all eventualities. Accidental damage, (dropped, rain or sand/dirt and so on) stolen from car, B&B/Hotel or even out on location. Also check to see if the insurance covers multiples items or just single items and the limits on each as you may find you can only claim for some of the equipment in your bag rather than all of it.If you want the protection of everything then there are insurance B&B/Hotel or even out on location. Also check to see if the insurance covers multiples items or just single items and the limits on each as you may find you can only claim for some of the equipment in your bag rather than all of it.If you want the protection of everything then there are insurance policies that will cover just about all eventualities and all equipment too. I have used for Infocus/Hiscox for a number of years and made claims without any issues. There are alternatives to them but I can't vouch for them as have no experience. EversureCAMERA CARE - #002 - BAG ITBuying a decent camera bag that has protective padding is essential to keep your camera and lenses from rolling around, knocking, scratching or even cracking as they jumble around whilst in transit in that loose rucksack. Just as important is getting the right size bag that caters for the gear to be comfortably packed rather then jammed into small spaces like sardines in a tin.When you think about the cost of a bag, or in my case multiple bags, so I have a choice about the size needed for the shoot and equipment I want to carry, its not a large cost given the price you paid for that gear. If looked after well it will protect your gear for many years to come, so also think about having enough room for expansion of gear in the future.Bags are always a personal choice so I can only give you my recommendations based on what suits me. See my post on my top 3 bags written a year ago. Since writing that blog I have added a new bag to my collection which I have been very happy with and would recommend if you have a reasonable amount of camera gear that you want to take out. Tamrac Evolution 9 Sling RucksackCAMERA CARE -#003 - CLEAN ITCamera's are always going to get some level of dirt, moisture and dust on them - its in the atmosphere so there isn't much you can do to avoid it getting on and into your camera. Buying a weather sealed camera of course will help reduce the elements invading your internal workings but even with a weather sealed camera there are still some maintenance cleaning tasks that need to be performed regularly. * Sensor Cleaning - You can damage your sensor if you are not careful so if you decided to buy your own swabs, charged sensor brush then make sure you find out how to perform a sensor clean before diving onto that sensor.You can pay me to clean it for you but in any event read my previous blog post on general camera cleaning and separate blog post on sensor cleaning . Even if you don't change lenses you will still get dust on your sensor due your zoom lenses not being airtight and sucking in dust as you zoom in and out. A sensor needs to be cleaned on a regular basis to avoid dust becoming \"baked\" onto the sensor over time as the sensor heats up each time you shoot. * Dry it - Yes, sounds obvious but maybe some people leave their damp equipment in the camera bag after a shoot. If you are shooting in damp/cold conditions then you need to ensure your equipment, camera body and lenses are dried afterwards. My routine is very simple but ensures I do not encourage the build up op of fungal spores and other nasty infections on my camera. If you have a warm room, where the boiler is ideal, just place a towel on top of the boiler and put your gear on it after the shoot. Remember to extend any zoom lenses, out fully so any moisture on the barrel is also able age the build up op of fungal spores and other nasty infections on my camera. If you have a warm room, where the boiler is ideal, just place a towel on top of the boiler and put your gear on it after the shoot. Remember to extend any zoom lenses, out fully so any moisture on the barrel is also able to dry and take off the lens cap! Likewise do the same for your tripod, standing up fully extended so that all the moisture can dry out at room temperature.I also regularly replace and use silicon gel bags in my camera bag they can absorb up to 1/3 of their own weight in water/moisture vapour. You can buy a pack of 50 for less than £3. Silica Gel Pouches - Pack of 50 Other cleaning products I recommendAlso clean your camera bag out regularly, empty it completely, shake and rattle it to make sure every grain of sand, dirt falls out and wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth before leaving it to dry out (empty) in your warm room.CAMERA CARE - #004 - REDUCE ITReduce the amount of shots you take! This is not just good advice to slow you down and make you observe and consider more but it also reduces the amount of times the shutter fires on your camera. This is especially true on continuous burst mode. Yes this is a great feature of digital photography in all types of shooting situations - portraits, wildlife, sports and landscapes when timing is essential to freeze/capture the moment, however camera's that have a mirror mechanism also have a limit on how many shots can be made over the life of the camera. This is called \"number of shutter actuations\" and is often quoted when buying a second hand camera. Though personally I think it's a bit meaningless unless you know/trust the seller as there is no way to prove the actual number of shots taken as the counters generally go up to 9999 and then start again at 0 so unlike your car's odometer there isn't an easy way to validate the claim.There is an on-line camera database that you can use to tell you what to expect out of your particular camera model in terms of shutter actuations so take a look for yourself.CAMERA CARE - #005 - LOVE ITYou don't quite have to wine and dine it but generally look after it, care about it and show it some love and it will reward you in the long run. I have lost count of the times I see people lay tripods and heads down on the ground or lean them up against walls and cars only for them to fall and cause damage. Or the countless times I see people changing a lens with the camera on the tripod and sensor exposed to air and dust as they turn and reach into their bag for the next lens rather than doing the whole operation kneeling down close to the ground over the camera bag with their back to the wind. Or even little things like leaving the bags compartment cover unzipped for the rain and dust to fall onto the inner contents or worse still the photographer who forgot it wasn't zipped up, grabbed their bag to move on and the contents flew across a 15 yard radius to the ground.It's impossible to list all the do's and don't s in a loving relationship - generally I think it's a case of common sense and just valuing what you have and ensuring you do your best at all times for camera care.photography-tips Alan Ranger 20 April 2022tips LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "JACKI ROSIN ARPS - RHS EXHIBITION AT THE SAATCHI GALLERYRHS EXHIBITIONGuest Post by Jacki Rosin ARPSBrowsing through my emails a few weeks ago, I came across some correspondence from the Royal Horticultural Society about their photographic competition. Further investigation showed there were several photographic categories that could be entered, including a Portfolio for a RHS ExhibitionThis category is for a compilation of six images in a series or on a common theme, with 'stylistic integrity throughout the display' and is judged for RHS Medals at the Botanical Art and Photography Show.I still had the images that I submitted or shortlisted for my ARPS on my hard drive and thought I had nothing to lose by submitting six of them.It was very much a spur of the moment decision! Three weeks later I received an email to say that the images had been shortlisted out of over a 100 entries and I would be taking part in the RHS exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in London.Since then, I’ve had to fill in a lot of paperwork and forms. The images are now with One Vision Imaging for printing and mounting and will soon be on their way to the gallery.The RHS exhibition runs from the 9th -29th April at the Saatchi Gallery, Kings Road, Londonhttps://www.saatchigallery.com/exhibition/rhs2022#_> Couldn’t have done it without Alan’s help for my ARPS so thank you!Jacki Rosin.Well done, Jacki; I am very proud of this great achievement, and I hope it spurs you on to m rom the 9th -29th April at the Saatchi Gallery, Kings Road, Londonhttps://www.saatchigallery.com/exhibition/rhs2022#_> Couldn’t have done it without Alan’s help for my ARPS so thank you!Jacki Rosin.Well done, Jacki; I am very proud of this great achievement, and I hope it spurs you on to more accolades like this and maybe a new project soon!

      "articleBody": "SHOOT THE MAGIC OF LANDSCAPE WINTER PHOTOGRAPHY | GUIDECAPTURE THE MAGIC OF LANDSCAPE WINTER PHOTOGRAPHYWinter is a fantastic time for landscape photography. It's all to easy, and somewhat understandable, why many people prefer to stay in the warmth and comfort of their homes between January and March rather than endure the bitter temperatures, sometimes biting winds and often unpopulated areas around the UK.However, seasoned landscape photographers know only to well that winter has a number of unique benefits to other times of the year for making landscape photos with impact.View fullsizeWales Landscape in the snow.Winter is not just about the weather and we certainly don't need snow or severe weather to make it worth going out. The winter season also has 3 special qualities that reward those who are prepared to venture out.WINTER PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHT:The sun does not rise to high throughout the winter months, as we all know from driving the car and being blinded by it low position in the sky. The low sun means that the light is lower and less contrasty than other seasons. So despite a shorter day in terms of sunlight the best shooting hours are generally longer as you don't have that 3-4hr period in the middle of the day where the pictures you take can easily end up as just practise shots rather than keepers.WarwickshireView fullsizeWalesWINTER PHOTOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT:Winter is actually one of the best times to visit those popular beauty sp ger as you don't have that 3-4hr period in the middle of the day where the pictures you take can easily end up as just practise shots rather than keepers.WarwickshireView fullsizeWalesWINTER PHOTOGRAPHY ENVIRONMENT:Winter is actually one of the best times to visit those popular beauty spots around the UK - the lack of people reduces the the times of frustration when a red anoraked person decides to share your view by standing in it for a prolonged period. In addition to reduced people traffic the landscape is also actually very different. The lush green growth of spring and summer and the vibrant colour of autumn has gone and reveals a the bare coal face of the landscape. WarwickshireWINTER PHOTOGRAPHY SUBJECT:Rivers, seas, rocks, hedges, hills and trees all take on a more defined and skeletal feel to reveal hard shape and form. Shape and form are two of the basic visual building blocks to good composition and subject matter in any photo but especially in B&W photography. The subjects in your images do not just have to be constrained to B&W or big vista's and the classic landscape shots. Winter also provides plenty of opportunity for you to work close up with macro or abstract photography as the weather and elements also bring new textures and colour to the subjects.View fullsizewinter water abstractView fullsizeIcescapeDon't be put off by uncomfortable weather - as they say up in the Lake District - \"there's so no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing\" - I run photography workshops throughout the year in all weather and can say that some of my personal favourite shots have been made in the worst weather. Warm clothes and a good attitude will mean you can focus on the amazing array of photographic opportunities at this time of year so why not join me on one my weekend photography workshops in Feb & Mar.All landscape workshops have an option for tuition only, this enables you to make your own way to the location and meet me at the start of the workshop there. You could think about booking an overnight before or after and extending your trip with an extra day's tuition or just making your own way around the area. Alternatively let me arrange everything for you, drive you there and around the locations and then enjoy the evening in my company at the hotel we stay at.Take a look at my upcoming events and Photography Workshop chose from a great range of photography workshops in Wales, Devon and the enchanting Lake District.photography-workshops Alan Ranger 0 Tumblr Pinterest0",

In addition, Dennis is a perfectionist, so he wanted to try various panel and image iterations even though, as I told him, he was ready six months earlier than when he finally took the plunge.Therefore, it’s a testament to Dennis that he had the persistence and motivation to keep going with the project and finally achieve the deserved accreditation. His final panel shows the variety, abstract, wildlife, architecture, environmental portrait, street photography, travel and range of exposure times, depth of field, lighting situations that are all essential for a successful RPS panel.Dennis supplemented my RPS Classes with several 1-2-1’s to improve his photo editing skills in Lightroom and DXO NIK plugins. In doing so he improved his visual awareness skills considerably and now has a better understanding of the whole photographic process from seeing, designing, shooting, enhancing and the final output.Well done Dennis a richly deserved ach his photo editing skills in Lightroom and DXO NIK plugins.

WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?I had subscribed to RPS for many years and therefore saw successful panels and always wondered whether I could get up to that standard. At 71 I decided to put that to the test.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS MENTORING COURSE?I wasn’t a member of a photography club with regular competitions and consequently didn’t have much experience of selecting images against a set of criteria and for those images to be critiqued by someone else. I, therefore, needed to learn those skills. Before joining the course, I attended one of Alan’s Arboretum workshops. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. I started the programme just before Covid and therefore had three face-to-face group sessions. Subsequently, the sessions were on Zoom. Both face-to-face and Zoom sessions enabled me to see what other photographers at various stages in the process were submitting and hear Alan’s comments about their images.Alan sets high standards! He taught me to look more critically for compositional and technical errors. He suggested how post-processing may improve potential images but there isn’t time on the programme, nor is it one of the course objectives, for Alan to teach post-processing. I, therefore, did Group Zoom courses with him and RPS trainers on Nik, Lightroom and Photoshop to tackle post-processing in a systematic way to achieve an objective.I extended the course to two years simply because there were periods in the initial year when other priorities arose. Deep down I’m a ‘perfectionist’ and consequently, despite Alan’s patience, support and advice, I began to realise that I was in a cycle of wanting to continually ‘improve ‘every image. I also had numerous other major commitments vying for my time. I, therefore, decided to stop the course at that point and take stock.After a period when I dealt with those other priorities, I re-focused on the project. I realised the only way for me to determine whether I had reached the RPS standard was to submit a panel without further feedback /training sessions. I reviewed the images and spares presented to the RPS Portfolio Reviews and some other ‘favourites’ and selected a sub-set of images. Some images only required fine-tuning to be candidates for the panel, whilst others required a processing plan from a ‘stable’ image. However, I believed I had the training to select a panel and process those images in a consistent way.The final stage for me was to print the panel plus ‘variants’ full size so I could see them physically in place within the prospective panel rather than on a screen.Throughout the course, Alan emphasised to all candidates that it was their panel which they needed to own. He was simply expressing an opinion. It is a testament to the tra panel plus ‘variants’ full size so I could see them physically in place within the prospective panel rather than on a screen.Throughout the course, Alan emphasised to all candidates that it was their panel which they needed to own. He was simply expressing an opinion. It is a testament to the training I’d received, that despite a five-month break, I was able to select the final images and create a panel I was happy with and met the standard required. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?YES 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? No. I knew that within my catalogue, I had some ‘good’ photographs, but I learned from Alan’s critique, that even the ‘good’ photographs could be improved by targeted post-processing to get them to an ‘appropriate’ standard. I also learned how to create a ‘panel’ which I hadn’t done before. After the course, I felt confident that I could achieve the standard.6. WHAT RPS DISTINCTIONS DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?I successfully submitted a panel for the Print ‘Licentiate’ Fine Art. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS DISTINCTIONS ASSESSMENT DAY?I found the RPS staff very helpful in dealing with queries I had about the submission prior to the Assessment but I had a prior commitment on the day of the Assessment.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I’m aware some applicants use Club Members or Judges to get feedback on their prospective panel. Not being a member of a club meant I didn’t have that resource. However, I did use the two RPS Distinctions 1:1 Portfolio Reviews to help me review individual images and alternative panels. Both reviewers also empathised that their review was a personal opinion but being able to discuss draft panels and substitutes with panel members were very useful. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND RPS DISTINCTIONS ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?If you can accept ‘critique’ and learn from that process you should go for it! With Alan’s guidance, as a minimum, you will learn to be a better photographer and, if you acquire the necessary skills, you will have the satisfaction of your achievement being recognised. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?The hardest part of the process was the creation of a cohesive panel rather than simply selecting my 10 ‘best images’. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A RPS DISTINCTIONS HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Yes. That was one of the objectives and consequently, I tried to ensure that I did so across the whole range of skills required to gain the Licentiate. 12.

      "articleBody": "CHOOSING A CAMERA - CONSIDERATIONS AND COMPARISONSOne of the most common questions, when it comes to gear, that i am asked is– “can you give advice on choosing a camera?”This is a much harder question to advise on because a camera is very much a personal choice and like most things the criteria for choosing involves many variables: It’s like choosing a car!· Budget – how much can I afford or do I want to spend right now· Longevity – is this camera going to see me through the next 1, 2, 3, 5 or even 10 years?· Do I need to buy new or is second hand better?· Features – what type of photography is my main interest?· Size, weight and comfort?· Lens, accessories and all the add-ons?· Brand / Ease of use, support, service and knowledge?BUDGET - CHOOSING A CAMERAThis is of course a personal thing therefore hard for me to say much other than what I would say about any purchase really. Set a budget you can afford and try and get the best you can for that budget. Don’t be tempted into spending more just because of a feature or two that stretches you beyond your budget. There are so many extras you will end up buying to complete your photography kit bag that before you know it, you will have spent double the amount you had planned to.LongevityThe length of time you expect to have the camera is of course a factor when setting a budget. If you really feel that photography is something that will beco up buying to complete your photography kit bag that before you know it, you will have spent double the amount you had planned to.LongevityThe length of time you expect to have the camera is of course a factor when setting a budget. If you really feel that photography is something that will become a serious passion/hobby then naturally you will want something that will see you through at least a couple of years of progression. Of course it’s much harder to know this at the start of the journey, but I encounter a lot of people who bought early and then realised in the first year that the camera they had just couldn’t do it or made it too hard to achieve what they wanted. Try and think about what should see you through for 2-3 years. Whilst the second hand market is good it will depend on how current your camera model is and a little luck to get more than 50-60% of what you paid for it.New or Second-handThe obvious advantages of new are the “no quibble return” if anything goes wrong and of course the latest technological advances in sensors, mainly important when it comes to High ISO performance and some advances in focusing. The latest models also now include GPS which will show you exactly where your images were taken and some other nice but not essential features.Of course buying second-hand has some inherent risks of condition and wear and tear. Modern DSLR’s are good for at least a 100,000 shutter actuations (i.e. images taken). It’s not easy, in fact impossible to know how many images a second hand camera has taken because despite the numbering sequence, it’s easy to reset that counter (which goes to 9,999) or know how many cycles around the clock it has done. On the up side, you can of course end up with a highly specified DSLR for a lot less money and generally speaking you can also obtain a number of lenses and accessories as part of the package. Apart from checking for obvious signs of use and wear and tear it really is a case of buyer beware.However you can buy new on EBay too and I have found that are several good outlets that provide new camera’s, not just the current model, for a lot less than you would pay from the high street or even on a major online retailer that still provide 1 year warranty/guarantee.FEATURES FOR CHOOSING A CAMERA“The bells and whistles” – this is where you could easily end up blowing your budget as you get allured into an endless list of nice to haves. My main advice here is make yourself a prioritised shortlist of the things that you must have for your type of photography interest and those that are nice to have. You should consider the following:· High ISO performance – this is important if you want to shoot portraits, low light photography (events)· High resolution – megapixels/sensor size – wildlife and landscapes benefit most from this as it enables you to crop into an image and not lose too much resolution/pixel quality.· Image stabilisation – there are not many brands who have this built in-camera but if shooting handheld a lot then this will save you some money on lenses as every lens you buy will be stabilised by the camera body – this simply gives you a few more stops of control (the ability to hand hold the camera at shutter speeds slower than you could otherwise achieve on a non-stabilised set-up.)· HDR – High Dynamic Range simply means you can take a number of bracketed shots and have them blended in-camera automaticall ply gives you a few more stops of control (the ability to hand hold the camera at shutter speeds slower than you could otherwise achieve on a non-stabilised set-up.)· HDR – High Dynamic Range simply means you can take a number of bracketed shots and have them blended in-camera automatically rather than having to use software and do it yourself, post shoot. HDR in-camera is relatively new and not quite perfected, it also generally only does this in JPG format and whilst that’s fine for many, personally I still find shooting RAW bracketed frames and merging them myself produces better results for me.· Rapid Fire – also known as continuous shooting or burst mode. This enables you to shoot several frames per second with one continuous press on the shutter button. This is a really useful technique for portraits, sports, certain wildlife and even landscapes when you are trying to anticipate something with movement. The higher the bust rate (measured in frames per second) the more chance you have of getting a frame in a sequence you want.· Screen/LCD – they all come with LCD screens so what’s the big deal here? For me not much other than a high res screen that ideally flips out so I can use it at difficult heights to frame shots and therefore has “Live-View” on it. Personally having a touch screen doesn’t entice me, but one I can actually see does!Of course the above is not an exhaustive list but just some considerations: If you come across something that you don’t know the importance of then Google it or drop me an email and I’ll try and research and advise you.SIZE, WEIGHT & COMFORT - FOR CHOOSING A CAMERAAll camera’s list their weight and size on many websites, please check this or better still try and find a retail outlet where you can go and hold it and have a play. A camera needs to be balanced in your hands so you can comfortably hold it with a lens on and not get the dreaded wobbly hand syndrome! In addition if you end up with something to big it main deter you from taking it out and using it as often as you would like to.Check to see if you know anyone who has the camera you considering, to get their feedback (but be aware most people will always sing the praises of what they bought!) Better still why not hire one for a week or a weekend? There are plenty of sites now where hiring a camera is really simple not badly priced and it gives you a real opportunity to have a proper play with no pressure from a salesperson.Lens for Hire Hire a camera Lens Pimp CalumetLENSES, ACCESSORIES AND AD-ONSThis is where you end up spending more money – in fact you will end up spending more on these over time than the camera body. This is why doing some research now might pay dividends in the long run. Spend some time looking at the cost of each manufacturers lens range, cost and specs. Compare two lenses for price, e.g. 24-70mm from Canon, Nikon & Sony and the 70-200mm. Some manufacturers also charge extra for items, like lens hoods, that come as standard with other manufacturers lens.Am sure some of you have heard me say this before, but for those that haven’t, the lens is the most important part of the gear. The quality of the optics really does make a difference to the quality of the pixels/resolution/sharpness and of course depth of field with apertures. It was for this reason that I chose to stick with Sony for the last 10years as they have an exclusive deal with Carl st important part of the gear. The quality of the optics really does make a difference to the quality of the pixels/resolution/sharpness and of course depth of field with apertures. It was for this reason that I chose to stick with Sony for the last 10years as they have an exclusive deal with Carl Zeiss for their lens range. Yes I pay more for Carl Zeiss compared to Canon or Nikon equivalents but not vastly different in some cases and for the quality difference I am prepared to pay a little more.Your other big consideration with lens range is of course whether you think you will move to a full frame sensor camera at some point – if you think this is likely you need to be careful not to invest to much in lenses that only work on a crop sensor camera – or you will not only be having to change cameras but replacing all your lenses too!BRANDS - - CHOOSING A CAMERAYou should all know that I am not loyal or bias towards any brand – I think it’s a personal choice and I know all camera’s, in the right hands, will produce quality images. All of the above considerations are what should dictate your choice of brand not whether it’s trendy, popular or anything else superficial. Having said that there are of course a few market leaders for a reason and therefore some benefits to owning one of those brands. Second-hand market it vast and therefore competitive, knowledge, online forums, guidance and user support/advice is extensive and finally of course, but not so much an issue with any brand these days, is customer service from that manufacturer and their ongoing development path. PRICES - CHOOSING A CAMERATo give you some idea of price brackets then the following is a very rough guide: This is not an exhaustive list and by no means a recommendation, they are just examples and in fact you can easily find, for example, a brand new serious amateur range level model in the mid and even entry level price range when it’s more than two years since its release.Entry Level - <£350Nikon D3100/3200, Canon EOS 100D, Sony SLT A58, Pentax K500,Mid-Range Level - <£650Nikon D7000, Nikon D5100/D5200, Sony SLT A65/A37, Canon EOS 650D,700DSerious Amateur Level <£1000Canon EOS 70D, Sony SLT A77, Nikon D7100/D600Semi Pro Level £1500-£1800Nikon D800, Canon EOS 6D, Sony SLT A99Pro Level >£2000Canon EOS 5D Mark III, Nikon D3/D4So where to look? Other than hiring as mentioned earlier this website is very useful for selecting all sorts of criteria and then comparing side by side. A great resource that will have you spending hours of time drooling at the screen https://snapsort.com/http://snapsort.com/recommend#!Please remember that these are not gospel but hopefully allow you become more aware about what you are buying and the pros and cons of each. Finally it is, of course, worth shopping around. My advice is to avoid oversees based sites that offer amazing prices until you find out it doesn’t include import and duty costs and customer service and even reliability is rarely worth the risk.As a general check on pricing this site: https://www.camerapricebuster.com/ is great for checking prices and importantly the market trend pricing for that item, you don’t want to be buying it at the peak of its high price!Note that some outlets offer you part-exchange too, though again be aware you may get stung both ends of the transaction!PLEASE LIKE AND SHARE THIS POST IF YOU FOUND IT USEFUL USING THE SHARE LINK BELOWphoto pricing for that item, you don’t want to be buying it at the peak of its high price!Note that some outlets offer you part-exchange too, though again be aware you may get stung both ends of the transaction!PLEASE LIKE AND SHARE THIS POST IF YOU FOUND IT USEFUL USING THE SHARE LINK BELOWphotography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 0 Tumblr 0 Likes",

Having supported many clients through a journey of development and improvement, with their photography, over the past few years, I was aware that there is a growing group who have considered and are interested in going for accreditation with the RPS. Therefore I launched the RPS Group in February 2018.The course of classes will stretch your creative interpretation, technical camera execution, editing ability and finally the skill to pull together a panel of coherent images into a panel and set of prints of digital images for projection.I am pleased to say that after three years of launching the course we are making great progress with several more participants already reaching 75% or more of a draft panel that will be ready for submission this year. Plus a 100% success pass rate to date with nine clients achieving their distinctions. The collaborative format of each class is proving to be popular and a great way to get ideas, inspiration and discuss images collectively.If you are interested in joining this course and giving yourself a target to work on an image collection for RPS Distinction please get in touch to discuss or just bo llaborative format of each class is proving to be popular and a great way to get ideas, inspiration and discuss images collectively.If you are interested in joining this course and giving yourself a target to work on an image collection for RPS Distinction please get in touch to discuss or just book online.

      "articleBody": "5 REASONS WHY A TRIPOD WILL HELP YOU TO BECOME BETTER5 REASONS WHY A TRIPOD WILL HELP YOU TO BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHERA tripod is one of the most essential accessories available to photographers – and it is often one of the most undervalued.Everyone is familiar with the basic advantage of using a tripod: the solid platform will keep your camera steady and ensure pin-point sharp image quality whatever the environment. Yet there is so much more to this simple three legged tool.1. TIGHTER COMPOSITIONSA tripod allows you to slow down and really think about the scene that you want to capture. You can make minor panning, tilting and height adjustments to get tighter compositions and with ultimate image-control you’ll create the perfect shot. 2. ACHIEVE LONGER EXPOSUREThe effects of using long exposure in photography are stunning and it’s absolutely essential to make use of a tripod to create such enhanced images. This is because by lengthening the shutter speed on your camera you are exposing yourself to the risk of camera shaking and blurring.3. FORGET COMPROMISE OF DEPTH OF FIELD, ISO OR SHARPNESSFor maximum depth of field you’ll probably be shooting at a small aperture, and ISO 100 to 400. When light is slightly restricted a slower shutter speed is required to get adequate exposure in the image. By using a tripod you won’t need to compromise on anything and you’ll be able to achieve perfectly exposed and pin-sharp depth of field.4. EXPAND PHOTOGRA mall aperture, and ISO 100 to 400. When light is slightly restricted a slower shutter speed is required to get adequate exposure in the image. By using a tripod you won’t need to compromise on anything and you’ll be able to achieve perfectly exposed and pin-sharp depth of field.4. EXPAND PHOTOGRAPHIC RANGEThe number of subjects and situations where a tripod is essential or at least, beneficial, are endless. Night photography, macro or panoramic shots are just some examples that require an unnaturally steady hand due to the requirement of long exposure; however this is easily achievable when a sturdy tripod optimises the effect.5. TAKE A LOAD OFFAs a landscape photographer, you will need to carry around heavy sets of kit whilst hiking or climbing through tumultuous environments - and fatigue will be your enemy. It may, therefore, seem counterproductive to suggest that adding more equipment to your load, such as a tripod, will make life easier on location photo shoots. Yet there is logic to this madness: it makes sense to let your tripod do the work and avoid shaky hands. Join me on Photography Workshop s to get first-hand experience and learn how to make the most of your equipment on location.Available throughout the year, the carefully planned workshops are an ideal chance to savour the fun and expertise of personalised support from a renowned, professional photographer.If you would like to find out how I can help you to achieve stunning photography, call me on 07817017994 or email info@alanranger.com.photography-tips Alan Ranger 8 July 2021tripod LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "USING A ND FILTER FOR LONG EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY | A GUIDEWHAT A ND (NEUTRAL DENSITY) FILTER DOES AND HOW TO USE THEMI have been using neutral density filters for many years now and have enjoyed the affects you can get from them. A neutral density filter, AKA ND Filter, does nearly exactly as the name suggests - it reduces light, uniformly across the whole image without affecting colour - hence neutral.However, by causing the camera exposure time to be increased (because it it reducing the intensity of light coming into the camera) it does generally add a slight colour distortion to the image. More so when you are increase the amount of density and even more so if you buy the cheaper ND filters like Cokin.So why use a ND filter - simply because you like the affects of a longer exposure that flattens out details and creates a greater sense of movement and or contrast between detail and less detail.Maybe the easiest way to explain this is show some examples:Exposure 1/13th of a secondcharlecote - standard camera exposureThe image above was taken without a ND filter - standard exposure in Aperture Priority mode on the exposure dial with a 0.75 (2.5 stops) of a graduated neutral density to reduce the exposure level just on the sky - this enables the shadow and mid-tone areas to be exposed for more detail.Exposure 25 secondscharlecote - using a 6 stop neutral density filterThe second image, above, I added the Lee Little Stopper, which is a 6 stop ND fi raduated neutral density to reduce the exposure level just on the sky - this enables the shadow and mid-tone areas to be exposed for more detail.Exposure 25 secondscharlecote - using a 6 stop neutral density filterThe second image, above, I added the Lee Little Stopper, which is a 6 stop ND filter. This increased the exposure time to 25 seconds - notice how the sky now looses detail but enhances movement of the clouds and the flow and direction of the water is also enhanced.Exposure 122 Secondscharlecote - using a 10 stop neutral density filterThe third image, above, I used the Lee Big Stopper, which is a 10 stop ND filter. This increased the exposure time to 122 secs (2mins) - notice how the details reduce in the water and sky even more and the colour tone becomes more blue.HOW TO USE A ND FILTER 1. Set your composition and shot up as normal, taking time to frame the shot carefully, set aperture according to the depth of field you want and the focus point to achieve the depth of focus. 2. Take your initial test shot and check the histogram for exposure - use exposure compensation (AV) to make fine tune adjustments up or down to ensure you capture the best exposure possible. 3. Now make a note of the aperture (F number) and shutter speed that the camera has metered with your exposure compensation added into the equation. 4. The camera exposure modes, aperture and shutter priority (A or S) can only expose for a maximum of 30 seconds so you may need to switch to manual exposure mode (M) on your dial. 5. Set aperture to the same as you had in step 2 and change shutter speed to BULB mode. 6. You can either calculate in your head the exposure time required or use a smartphone app to provide you the extended exposure time based on the density of the filter you are using. example: * normal shot without ND filter - shutter speed = 0.25 @ F16 * Using a 6 stop ND means the exposure is extended to * 1 stop - 1/2 * 2 stop 1 sec * 3 stop 2 sec * 4 stop 4 sec * 5 stop 8 sec * 6 stop 16 sec * 7 stop 32 sec * 8 stop 64 sec * 9 stop 128 sec * 10 stop 256 sec 7. Smartphone apps - just type in ND on the apps store and there are several apps that you can use that will allow you to input the standard exposure time and convert the required exposure time based on the filters you are planning to use be it - 1 stop, 6 stop or 10 stop or any combination of filters you want to stack together and try. 8. If the required exposure time with the ND density you have chosen is greater than 30sec then you need to switch to Manual exposure and set the shutter speed to BULB 9. Before you insert/attach the ND filter set the camera's focus to manual focus, making sure you have already focused. 10. Now insert/attach your ND filter and using a remote release shutter release and timer (your phone will have one) expose the shot for the required time calculated in step 6.This should give you a good exposure if A) you calculated everything accurately B) the light didn't change dramatically between taking your test reading in step 3 and the end of exposure time in step 10.WHAT'S THE RIGHT ND TO USE?That's a really easy one to answer - it's entirely down to the affect you want to create - just experiment and have fun. The longer the exposure the greater the aff change dramatically between taking your test reading in step 3 and the end of exposure time in step 10.WHAT'S THE RIGHT ND TO USE?That's a really easy one to answer - it's entirely down to the affect you want to create - just experiment and have fun. The longer the exposure the greater the affect in the image and therefore its a personal preference and different for every situation.Remember you can buy ND filters in a variety of density strengths and you can always stack more than one on top of each other to increase the density.Hopefully this guide will help you enjoy and understand more on the use of ND filters, if you want to practice and find out more about the use of filters and how to use them then sign up for one of my courses or workshops and discover the many ways that you can create more exciting affects on your pictures, in camera! photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 6 July 2021filters LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "LEARN PHOTOGRAPHY - HOW? - 10,000 HOURS OF PRACTICELEARN PHOTOGRAPHY - 10,000 HOURS OF PRACTICEI am sure you know the meme from Malcolm Gladwell, about the 10,000 hour rule?Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 yearsI have also made the point, in lectures and classes, that If you practice something incorrectly for 10,000 hours you will be a master at doing it incorrectly.Sanjay Srivastava, made interesting points in his paper in “The Hardest Science” that apart from simply practice there has to be an innate talent to start with and goes on to point out that “luck” and “privilege” also play an important part in becoming successful. In layman's terms, these debates about what makes someone become ultra successful/good at what they do have been propagated and simplified to provide a way of conveying that all you need to do is practice and work hard and the results will come. The article goes on to make the case that there may be at least four elements involved in very successful outcomes, of course this largely depends on your measurement of success. * Talent - there is such a thing as talent and that it matters for success * Preparation - that practicing for 10,000 hours will goes on to make the case that there may be at least four elements involved in very successful outcomes, of course this largely depends on your measurement of success. * Talent - there is such a thing as talent and that it matters for success * Preparation - that practicing for 10,000 hours will make you better * Luck - being in the right place at the right time * Privilege - having the means (resources) to access the opportunityThis reminds me of a project I worked on as a management consultant twenty years or so ago. The organisation was attempting to change culture and bring about change in the way individuals worked to be better, as part of the sum of the digits, to produce momentum and create a swing in positive “outcomes”. I worked with a fellow external consultant, Howard, who worked with the British Rugby Team, prior to their world cup win in 2003, as a sports psychologist.The “simplified” philosophy became P=CxA2P= PerformanceC= CapabilityA2= Attitude SquaredMeaning, your performance is based on your innate capability multiplied by your attitude squared. This translates to whatever your capability is, your attitude has a larger factor to produce a better performance than your innate ability. Or in even simpler terms, loads of capability but poor attitude produces a piss poor performance and even a little little capability with a great attitude produces a great performance. PERFORMANCEYou only need to compare the performances and outcomes of the last two English World Cup Football teams. Consider the difference in how well England performed and progressed in 2014, with arguably a better squad of players but went out in qualifying rounds, verses 2018, where England reached the semi-finals with (arguably) less capability but a better attitude. An additional factor of leadership (tutor) may be brought into the equation too.I don’t have any major objection to the simplification of a narrative if it helps to inform and focus the reader's/receivers mind on the bigger picture rather than the details and problems of everything else.However the oversimplification of some things, (consider how the Brexit campaign was portrayed to the British Public as an example. Both sides made arguments that oversimplified what is clearly a very complex subject and one, in my opinion, that should not have been put to a referendum) can create a false paradigm. In the pursuit of becoming a better photographer, whether it’s for personal pleasure and hobby, professionally or any other purpose. It’s too easy to think that you just need buy the right gear, go to the right places, get enough social media likes and attention, sell a print, offer a portrait/wedding shoot or just practice lots to consider yourself successful or good.We all strive, aim and want to become better at whatever we do in life, whether it’s fitness, health, diet, a hobby, relationships, our career and so on. Suggesting that there are a set of simple steps, rules, guidelines or memes that we can adopt to achieve these goals is just a way of helping us focus our efforts and renew our motivation to improve. I am always hesitant, and even uncomfortable, about writing and proposing “10 Steps to…” becau on. Suggesting that there are a set of simple steps, rules, guidelines or memes that we can adopt to achieve these goals is just a way of helping us focus our efforts and renew our motivation to improve. I am always hesitant, and even uncomfortable, about writing and proposing “10 Steps to…” because they are in some way a false paradigm too. Despite the fact that I have written and sell “Pocket Guides - My Top Tips”However, having taught and met thousands of photographers at the novice and beginners level, I know they need a simplification of information, so they can see a way forwards and have a framework to work on a progress with. Ten step guides are useful for beginners learning about shutter speed, white balance, depth of field, rule of thirds, focusing, lighting and composition, metering and other aspects to learn the basics.I have been providing photography courses for beginners for the last six years on digital photography to help novices take what they feel are good photos and using editing software to become better photos through post production. Most don’t aspire to be a professional photographer, most just want to improve their photography skills for personal satisfaction and enjoyment of their hobby and subjects/places they photograph and experience.Not many have an innate creative and technical talent to take it a step further, so proposing that 10,000 hrs will make you successful, is of course false, if you don’t possess the raw ingredients that are required to meet your criteria of “success”. If you add the ingredients of Luck - (to be in the right place at the right time) and Privilege (the means to access) to the mix then it’s understandable to see how few can achieve panicea. STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT - LEARN PHOTOGRAPHYIMITATEHowever, for most people I meet, fortunately, panicea is based on a different model and criteria of success. Most just want to end the frustration of not understanding terminology, science and technicalities of the camera - The Mechanics. Using the camera to maximise its potential and help capture and record what they see and where they are. This is often based on a criteria of imitating shots they have seen of a subject or location and trying to put their own spin on it which of course will rely on circumstance (luck and privilege) of when they are there with what talent and preparation they have.Learning to use the instrument correctly, in this case the camera, is largely a technical exercise, coupled with practical experience and objective evaluation of the results. The objective evaluation can be achieved in many ways depending on your assessment of what’s valuable and insightful verses the extreme of what strokes your ego.For my own part, entering competitions, exhibitions, gaining accreditations and being part of the photographic communities ways of acknowledgement played a big part of getting external feedback on my work and progress. Whether it’s through camera clubs, the RPS, BPE or some other form and society, external feedback and formal recognition plays an important part of giving us targets, milestones and a way of motivating us to strive for improvement. I didn’t, and often don’t agree, with those assessments, outcomes and criteria but those are the ways and rules of those bodies so you have to play by them or vote with your feet and ignore them.ASSIMILATEOnce we have achieved a certain standard and have the confidence to execute technically, we sta n’t, and often don’t agree, with those assessments, outcomes and criteria but those are the ways and rules of those bodies so you have to play by them or vote with your feet and ignore them.ASSIMILATEOnce we have achieved a certain standard and have the confidence to execute technically, we start to face some difficult challenges. Assimilation - Making choices about what and how we photograph, applying our “personal” style to it through more considered compositions and skillful post-production. This part of the process becomes more difficult because it relies on having some talent, awareness and attitude and one could argue that luck and privilege play a part too.Creating images that speak to the reason for it, the intention, conveying the photographers interpretation and skillful presentation of their subject matter rely on being a master (or at least proficient) of the mechanics. Having a clear personal style and way of seeing and connecting to the subject matter is an ongoing journey that will mean a return to some new mechanics. You may imitate the work of others with more skill than before, and have less external confirmation as the pool of external credible assessors becomes shallower and therefore sometimes easier to ignore. However this stage is often a tipping point too.Gladwell defines a tipping point as \"the moment of critical mass” The idea, appetite, motivation, commitment reaches a tipping point for many, whose interest in photography is enjoyment and recreation rather than a passion and way of expression through the medium of a camera. Very few go on to strive for something beyond this point and, understandably, are fulfilled with what they have achieved and can produce when motivated to do so.INNOVATEThe personal execution of photography is a much sought after ideal. Is it possible to innovate and be original and unique in a field where literally hundreds of millions of people take literally billions of photos on a daily basis? We visit the same places, see similar things but somehow some people manage to see, capture and express the same thing we experience in a way that speaks a different language.Innovation is the direct result of hours upon hours of imitation and assimilation. It’s the result of travelling that road of learning every lesson, putting it into regular practice with confidence and reason and then taking it to another level. Of course there are different stages and levels within this and some people seem create something completely unique, others variations of uniqueness. What’s most important is it doesn’t have to be 100% unique - It has to be 100% authentically YOU, and you have to be fulfilled with the work regardless of external opinion.WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US? - LEARN PHOTOGRAPHYNot everyone wants to become a professional, achieve formal accreditations or qualifications. Most people I meet simply enjoy photography as a hobby and means of getting out and exploring new places and environments. Naturally some want more or less input, guidance and challenges.I will write something soon to share my insights of the photography lessons I feel will benefit any level of photographer with any level of ambition.

It will cover the intellectual, emotional and physical steps required to improve year on year.The most important advice I can give and best less otographer with any level of ambition.

      "articleBody": "BENRO REVIEW - HEAD TO HEAD WITH GITZO AND MANFROTTO TRIPODSI have been a proud owner of the Gitzo GT3532LS Tripods with the Manfrotto 405 Pro Geared Head for nearly ten years. Just after the Photography Show in March 2009, I purchased the combination that has been the de facto choice for most landscape photographers for many years. Now its time to compare the Benro head to head with the Gitzo.Overall the GT3532LS and 405 geared head has served me very well and has certainly clocked some mileage over that ten-year period, not to mention being under some extreme conditions of wind, salt water, snow, ice and, of course, plenty of rain in that time. Given it has survived ten years and is still in good working order, I can’t really complain about the cost over that period - c£100 per year.Let’s jump straight into why I am now looking at the Benro alternative setup. There are three main factors that led me to consider a change last September.Gitzo GT3532LS Legs with Manfrotto 405 Pro Geared Head - Client - Joyce James 1. The GT3532LS legs have needed two replacement legs over the ten years due to the carbon fibre breaking down and splintering. I wouldn’t say that was definitely down to the quality of the product, but anyone who knows me, knows I take very good care of my equipment. Secondly, the G-Lock rubber seals, that you use to tighten and untighten and the 3 legs have stretched over the years and when wet from rain they become very loose, making it difficult finitely down to the quality of the product, but anyone who knows me, knows I take very good care of my equipment. Secondly, the G-Lock rubber seals, that you use to tighten and untighten and the 3 legs have stretched over the years and when wet from rain they become very loose, making it difficult and often frustrating to get a secure lock on the leg positions. 2. The overall weight of the GT3532LS legs with the Manfrotto 405 Geared Head is a consideration when you are walking up hills or over any distance with all your other equipment. Whilst I certainly wouldn’t call the combination heavy, it certainly reminds you that you are carrying it when you walk more than a mile or two or an ascent. It is worth pointing out early on in this review that the majority of the weight burden comes from the Manfrotto 405 Geared Head as you will see from the comparison table below. 3. I am frequently asked by clients what tripods and head I recommend for them. We all know this question always results in the “depends” response but even when the answer is the GT3532LS legs with the Manfrotto 405 Geared Head the cost becomes a barrier for most amateurs with not much change from a £1,000 and that’s if you manage to find a deal somewhere. So this review will hopefully meet the needs of some of those enquiries.Having acquired the Mefoto Globetrotter - Carbon Fibre a few years back, for use when travelling overseas, I was interested to see if the MAC Group also produced a good alternative to the Gitzo/405 setup. Benro is one of the brands in the MAC Group, alongside Mefoto and Tenba. I was so impressed with the Mefoto Globetrotter as my lightweight (3.70 lbs), compact and sturdy solution it has been my top recommendation for the majority of my clients for the last two-three years. The aluminium version is excellent value at around £110-£150 (depending on what colour you pick) that it falls within most amateurs budget and needs.Link Mefoto Globetrotter on Amazon Following a discussion with the MAC Group Brand Manager I discovered that they were about to launch a combination head and legs that would be an ideal match and comparison to Gitzo/405 combination, so when then the Benro product arrived in early November 2018 I was very excited to unpack it and give it a road test, which happened to be Glencoe a week later.The first impressions of what arrived were excellent. Clearly great build quality in the geared head and tripod legs but I was also impressed with all of the accessories that are included. Various feet and attachments, tool kit and a padded protective carrying bag all reassured me that this was a quality product straight out of the box. The test would be in its use out in the field or in my case in wet conditions in Scotland.Since that inaugural trip I have not used the Gitzo/405 combination and the C3770TN Benro Combination Tripod with the GD3WH Geared Head has become my default setup on workshops. So far, over 15 workshops later and over the equivalent of out in the field or in my case in wet conditions in Scotland.Since that inaugural trip I have not used the Gitzo/405 combination and the C3770TN Benro Combination Tripod with the GD3WH Geared Head has become my default setup on workshops. So far, over 15 workshops later and over the equivalent of 25 days in use, it has stood up to every test and has not shown any issues. Now, of course, I have to be fair and say that the Gitzo/405 combination has had 10 years of hard use so can I really compare one over the other? The answer is probably not just yet, but my experience tells me that the C3770TN legs definitely feel more durable and easier to use than the Gitzo 3532LS, importantly the G-lock seal's on the C3770TN feel more rugged and secure than the Gitzo ever does, even when new. Time will tell if the Benro-combo stands the test of time and durability.----------------------------------------KEY FACTORS FOR CHOOSING A TRIPOD SET-UPWhen it comes to selecting a tripod and head there are generally five factors to consider. I posted a blog about these considerations in 2018 * Height * Weight * Budget * Stability * FlexibilityI guess I should now add the sixth which would be durability after all we want our equipment to stand the test of time and hopefully invest only once and wisely.Weight, height and flexibility certainly count a great deal towards the comfort and enjoyment of using a tripod and stability is non-negotiable. I have witnessed far too many photographers, over the years, wrestling with a inadequate tripod and head, watching their patience and creativity drain away because they didn’t purchase the right tool for the job in hand or in this case the camera/lens combination.I can say outright that both the Gitzo/405 and Benro set-ups both perform well on height, weight, stability and flexibility. As I have said it’s too early to say whether the Benro setup will suffer the same durability issues that the Gitzo tripods legs have had after years of use but the Benro setup certainly beats the Gitzo/405 hands down on budget costing approximately £350-£500 less and weight.SPECIFICATIONSLet’s get down to the specifications of both set-ups. The first thing I should point out is that the Benro Gear Head is a closer comparison to the Manfrotto 410 Junior Geared Head . This the 405’s baby brother, a head that I have never owned as when using a clients I found the micrometric knobs positioned too close together for my fingers to easily and quickly make adjustments, I think the “ergonomic” grips are simply too small/low profile to wrap your fingers around with a comfortable grip. However, for the purposes of a like for like comparison, I am including both Manfrotto geared heads.----------------------------------------COMPARISON OF TRIPOD LEGS - BENRO VS GITZOView fullsizeView fullsizeExtended Feet SpikesNote both Tripods have three leg sections with no centre column, allowing a lower position to the ground for minimum height shooting.Both tripods come with a range of different feet and adapters for different heads.

Currently this is not possible as some of the head controls are lower than the mounting base of the head. The adapter simply screws on to the top of the tripod using the 3/8” thread and provides a raised platform so that the Geared Head can be attached, allowing full tilt up/down and landscape/portrait movement of the head.BENRO GEARED HEAD COMPONENTSView fullsizeBenro GD3WHView fullsizeBenro Geared Head Adapter - GDHAD1View fullsizeArca-Swiss PU70 PlateMANFROTTO GEARED HEAD COMPONENTSView fullsizeManfrotto 405 Pro Geared HeadView fullsizeManfrotto 410 Junior Geared HeadView fullsizeManfrotto 410 Plate----------------------------------------COMBINATIONSGITZO/MANFROTTO VS BENRO - TRIPODSNote prices are based on average selling price at the time of writing. You may find items cheaper or more expensive depending on the retailer. * If you already own the Gitzo tripod legs you can just upgrade your tripods head to a Benro geared head with the adapter to gain a saving on weight and usability.View fullsizeView fullsizeBenro Head & AdapterView fullsizeFeaturesView fullsizeMovement----------------------------------------VERDICT - TRIPODSWithout overstating the obvious, the Benro system is much more affordable than both the Gitzo/Manfrotto combinations with a massive 40% saving on cost. So the obvious question might be, so do I think there is a 40% degradation in performance against my five factors for a tripod setup? NO, absolutely not.Leaving durability out of the equation for now, as I haven’t had the Benro system long enough to make a fair comparison, let's look at my five factors again.HeightBoth tripods leg systems are pretty much identical with the Gitzo legs just having an extra 2cm on max height and 3cm advantage on minimum height. However, if you add the 4.5cm height of the Benro Geared Head Adapter onto the Benro tripod legs then the overall height advantage goes to Benro.Winner - BenroWeightGiven I was comparing my existing setup (Gitzo/Manfrotto 2) against the Benro system then I have saved a whopping 0.96kg (26%) in weight. This may not sound much but trust me every ½ kg counts when you are on your feet for 12 hours on location and walking across varied terrains.Winner - BenroBudgetWhether you choose or prefer the smaller geared head or larger one from Manfrotto you are going to save a lot of kg (26%) in weight. This may not sound much but trust me every ½ kg counts when you are on your feet for 12 hours on location and walking across varied terrains.Winner - BenroBudgetWhether you choose or prefer the smaller geared head or larger one from Manfrotto you are going to save a lot of cash with the Benro geared head. As combined systems, the Benro beats the other combinations hands-down being 33% (£305) less on combination 1 and 45% (£505) less than combination 2.Winner - BenroStabilityBoth systems offer maximum loads way beyond my needs as a landscape photographer. My heaviest combination on the systems is the Sony A99 mkII (0.849kg) with a 70-200mm F2.8 (1.3kg) combined weight of 2.14kg plus a Lee Filter system with multiple filters still does not even get close to the maximum loads of tripod legs and heads on both systems of 5kg on the heads.Winner - EqualFlexibilityLegs - As both systems can go down pretty much to ground level and have similar maximum heights too then as tripod legs go I’d say they are equal in flexibility. However, the Benro tripod legs do feel a lot easier to handle and adjust with bigger grips on the leg adjustments plus the small extra of a padded/velcro holding sleeve on the Benro’s systems leg does provide comfort and protection.Heads - Comparing the Benro Geared Head to the Manfrotto 405 head is trickier. I love the weight saving of nearly 1 kg lighter on the Benro head and it also outperforms the comparison Junior 410 Manfrotto headI can actually get my fingers around the knobs and make adjustments reasonably well. However, the head movement on the Benro is sometimes a bit stiff if you have moved either the lateral or front tilt to maximum positions. On occasions, I have found it tricky to then re-adjust the tilt quickly compared to the Manfrotto 405. Is it worth the extra weight of the Manfrotto, no, not in my opinion?Winner - Benro----------------------------------------WHERE TO TRY AND BY TRIPODS?If you are attending this years photography show at the NEC, Birmingham, 16th-19th Mar 2019, then visit their stand (D101) and you can talk to the folks there and handle the tripods/heads and combinations for yourself. If you want to buy then currently, it seems that only WEX are retailers for the GDHAD1 Head Adaptor I have referenced but you can purchase the Tripod and Geared Head on Amazon or other retailers.LINKS: TRIPODSWex Benro Combination Series 3 Carbon Twist 3 Section Tripod Amazon Benro Combination Series 3 Carbon Twist 3 Section Tripod Wex Benro GD3WH Precision Geared Head Amazon Benro GD3WH Precision Geared Head Wex Benro GDHAD1 Geared Head Adaptor Other equipment I recommend ----------------------------------------REMEMBER TO VISIT MY PHOTOGRAPHY BL",

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHERS COMPOSITION AIDES - VIEWING FRAMES LAUNCHEDCOMPOSITION GUIDE - PHOTOGRAPHERS VIEWING FRAME FAQWHAT IS IT?A viewing frame, composition guide, is a piece of mount card with a window cut out (aperture) of the centre at a specific aspect ratio. (An aspect ratio is a proportional relationship between an image's width and height. Essentially, it describes an image's shape. Aspect ratios are written as a formula of width to height, like this: 3:2. For example, a square image has an aspect ratio of 1:1, since the height and width are the same)WHY IS IT USED?The viewing window is used by photographers to help them eliminate surroundings and objects in a scene to help them frame a composition. Because it is small and lightweight and portable it can be easily used to help frame a subject without using the camera and lens. The viewing cards come in a range of aspect ratio sizes to help identify which aspect ratio to use in-camera or to crop the image to once the image is in computer software.HOW IS IT USED?1. Hold the viewing frame at approximately 25cm away from one eye (which is approximately your elbow at a right angle)2. and close the other eye, as you do when looking through a camera viewfinder. This will help you to isolate your subject within the inner frame and work out your height, perspective, and framing options.Holding the viewing card at 25cm away from your eye is equivalent to the field of view of a 35mm focal length on your lens. (it do when looking through a camera viewfinder. This will help you to isolate your subject within the inner frame and work out your height, perspective, and framing options.Holding the viewing card at 25cm away from your eye is equivalent to the field of view of a 35mm focal length on your lens. (it is 25cm because this is approximately the equivalent of the minimum focus distancing of the human eye, referred to as the near point). Therefore, the more you extend your arm away from your eye the longer the focal length beyond 35mm (full-frame sensor) you will use to create the same frame in the camera that you see with the viewing card.WHEN IS IT USED?1. Whenever you are out with your camera and eyeing up a potential shot. Yes, you could do this using your camera viewfinder but that involves your camera and changing aspect ratio settings on your camera to achieve the cropped perspective. The beauty of this accessory is that it allows you to work pre-camera in a way that concentrates the mind on that window of vision without using the camera.2. Surely, I can just crop the frame when back home to any of these aspect ratios… Yes, that’s true and all of us do that to some extent, but working the dimensions by the eye than in-camera not only preserves maximum resolution/pixels it enables us to see a better composition pre “post-production” and helps us chose the right lens focal length, DoF and perspective/angle before setting up the camera and tripod----------------------------------------BUY YOUR SET OF PHOTOGRAPHERS COMPOSITION FRAMESThe black frames come as a set covering six aspect ratios; * 3:2 ratio.

Sign up here if you want to receive these by email Hopefully, with more downtime, you will be able to read and learn photography basics or refresh your understanding. This one is not sixty seconds read :)----------------------------------------TEN TIPS TOWARDS BETTER COMPOSITION#01 SHOOTING FROM WHERE YOUR FEET LAND - BETTER COMPOSITION> “The eye should learn to listen before it looks.” Just because you happen to stop at a certain point or notice something you want to shoot doesn't mean that this is the ideal position, height, angle to immediately take the photograph from. In fact, it would probably be a miracle if you were always automatically arriving in the ideal position every time. Where you have the chance, spend some time changing your point of view, height, angle and perspective. Look at the light, shadows and how you can separate objects in the frame so they don’t blend together or overlap.#02 INCLUDING TOO MUCH IN THE FRAME - BETTER COMPOSITION> “The painter constructs, the photographer discloses.” Creating photographs more accurately describes the process of being a photographer than taking a photograph. Consideration has to be made to what the important and essential elements of the picture are. The best principle to apply for a beginner is to keep it simple! The more you r discloses.” Creating photographs more accurately describes the process of being a photographer than taking a photograph. Consideration has to be made to what the important and essential elements of the picture are. The best principle to apply for a beginner is to keep it simple! The more you include in a photograph the more complex and potentially unambiguous the image becomes. Start with framing just the most important thing and only add other things as “props” to the main subject when they can justify their part in the photo without becoming a distraction.#03 NO FOCAL POINT - BETTER COMPOSITION> “For me, the subject of the picture is always more important than the picture.” Make it clear to the viewer what to look at first, second and third. Make sure your focal point is positioned accurately and the composition has a strong leading line, direction and balance to your subject. Placing your main subject dead centre of the frame will not allow the viewer’s eye to explore the rest of the frame. It’s essential to make sure all the elements in the frame are well-positioned and support the main subject in terms of space, depth and perspective. Create each image with a sense of balance!#04 NO CLEAR INTENTION - BETTER COMPOSITION> “Photography is the story I fail to put into words.” There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept – every photograph you take should inform the viewer of the photographer’s intention. Making a photograph is telling a story. It has many constructs to it and reflects the vision and interpretation of the person behind the camera and their relationship to the subject. “The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.”#05 CONNECT TO YOUR SUBJECT - BETTER COMPOSITION> “Don’t shoot what it looks like. Shoot what it feels like.”Recording the world and subjects in it as they are seen by human eyesight does not necessarily show us anything different. In fact, it rarely provokes an emotional response from the viewer unless it’s a startling image captured for journalistic & historical purposes. So how do you turn the ordinary into the extraordinary? Try asking yourself, what do I feel about this subject? Using the one or two words you come up with in your head, focus on making a picture that communicates just those words. #06 BE PATIENT – BE DETERMINED - BETTER COMPOSITION> “Patience is the essence of clicking great Photographs!”If a shot is worth getting it’s worth waiting for! So many times I witness beginners taking photos as if it was a fast-food activity – in – out – consume – job done. However, when you go out for a special meal you are happy to take your time, enjoy the experience, and relish the flavours and different courses and the company you are with. Creating photographs can, at times, be as much about enjoying the experience of being somewhere and experiencing something as it is getting a shot of it. I have found that simply absorbing my surroundings, watching the changing light and elements has enabled me to take that special shot rather than just any shot.#07 DON’T LET COMPOSITION RULES STIFLE YOUR CREATIVITY - BETTER COMPOSITION> “To consult the rules of composition before making a picture is a little like consulting the law of gravitation before going for a walk.” Most cameras now show you the rule of thirds. However, you can end up being in a straight-jacket and taking photos based on formula and n ETTER COMPOSITION> “To consult the rules of composition before making a picture is a little like consulting the law of gravitation before going for a walk.” Most cameras now show you the rule of thirds. However, you can end up being in a straight-jacket and taking photos based on formula and numbers, which if you’re not careful, won’t allow the expression of your individuality. The rules of composition are a great aid for the beginner trying to move from centrally composed images, but it’s also worth always trying to break the rules to create something more interesting. If it feels balanced and natural to you then that is a good indication that it works. Use the composition rules as a guide not an instruction.#08 FAIL TO PLAN, PREPARE TO FAIL - BETTER COMPOSITION> “Always seeing something, never seeing nothing, being photographer”Despite all the planning, research and preparation you can put into shooting at a location, sometimes things just won’t work out as you had hoped with light, weather and subject.However, I always try to give beginners two pieces of advice. Firstly always try to put in the research about timing your visit to a location to maximise the chances of getting the right conditions you want to capture. Secondly, when despite those conditions not being as you had planned to be prepared to change your objectives and the type of shots you can get. It’s often the ability to adapt that brings us the greatest rewards.#09 PAY ATTENTION TO THE LIGHT - BETTER COMPOSITION> “In the right light, at the right time, everything is extraordinary” A The eye is always drawn to the brightest part of an image – therefore it’s important that you either position yourself, the framing of the shot and main subject with the light falling on it rather than something else. Sometimes you have to wait for the light if shooting a landscape, other times it’s simply a case of moving your position to catch the light from a different angle. In any situation, the light in your photo is fundamental to drawing the viewers’ attention to the subject and can turn the ordinary into extraordinary in a moment!#10 WATCH OUT FOR FOREGROUND & BACKGROUND INTRUDERS - BETTER COMPOSITION> “A photograph is a secret about a secret. The more it tells you, the less you know” Backgrounds/foregrounds in an image need to be balanced and in context to the main subject. Sometimes you can completely blur the background to make the foreground subject really stand out in contrast. Other times the background is an essential part of the image that gives the foreground context and vice versa with the background. Always check your images after taking them for anything that might distract from the main subject, be it a fuzzy background or foreground or intruders that creep into the shot from the edge of the frame. Usually, showing less is far more compelling.----------------------------------------SIGN UP FOR ONE OF MY WEBINAR, ONLINE PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS TUTORIALS - EDITING WITH LIGHTROOM AND NIK, B&W CONVERSION, FILTERS & BRACKETING, COMPOSITION AND MORE…----------------------------------------If you want to support my business and invest something for when we return to normal working ways you can buy yourself a digital gift voucher.

Always start with extending the smallest, bottom legs first. It’s will help prevent dirt, sand and grit being pushed up inside the next leg and preserve the joints. 2. Increase the tripod height by extending bottom legs fully first, then the next section and finally top section. It saves you bending down to make height adjustments. 3. Always extend the legs fully so they are at their widest stopping point at that angle. Most tripod legs allow two or three further width positions if needed to stabilise further or get lower down. 4. Try to get the tripod as level as possible. Use the spirit level on the tripod head or stand 90 degrees on (to side) and look at the centre column to see if it looks 180 degrees vertical (for those that don’t do degrees that’s 6 O’clock with clock hands) 5. Always have one tripod leg pointing out at the same angle as the lens. Having a tripod leg under the lens reduces the chance of the tripod falling forwards and means you will be positioned between the rear two legs /\\USING THE TRIPOD - HOW TO USE A TRIPOD CORRECTLY 1. Only use the centre column as the last resort to leg pointing out at the same angle as the lens. Having a tripod leg under the lens reduces the chance of the tripod falling forwards and means you will be positioned between the rear two legs /\\USING THE TRIPOD - HOW TO USE A TRIPOD CORRECTLY 1. Only use the centre column as the last resort to get extra height. Extending the centre column is a single point of connection versus three so destabilises the weight distribution. 2. If you are using a heavier zoom lens, make sure to mount the lens on your tripod using its tripod collar. This will redistribute and balance the weight of camera and lens. 3. Invest in a detachable camera strap system. Straps flap around in the wind causing vibration, are annoying when you are working on a tripod and worse still a hazard if you catch your hand/arm and topple the tripod over. 4. Use a cable remote release or control (or 2sec timer) to fire the exposure. There’s not much point having a stable tripod setup if you then introduce movement and vibration by using your finger to take the shot. 5. Turn Off Image Stabilization: When your gear is on a stable setup, you do not want image stabilization to try to compensate for movement that is not there.CARING FOR THE TRIPOD - HOW TO USE A TRIPOD CORRECTLY 1. Always leave an inch of the smallest let extended, even when storing, it allows time for the dirt to dry and fall off the feet and bottom inch of the leg. 2. Clean the tripod with a damp (water) cloth, do not use soap or other liquids. 3. Use a small soft brush or old toothbrush to remove sand and dirt from tripod leg joints. 4. Always stand a tripod on 3 legs fully extended when out and about, laying a tripod down on its side is not going to preserve it at its best and will undoubtedly increase the risk of damage to the section joints and tripod head 5. Store it standing up if possible, or laying down in a soft padded bag in a dry place so it has time to dry off and is protected from knocks and accidents.If you wish to purchase any of the accessories mentioned in these tips, please visit my Amazon recommended products page .----------------------------------------MORE FREE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS/blog-on-photography/photographing-autumn-uk-landscape-photography-guidePhotographing Autumn - UK landscape photography guide Photographing autumn: Experience the colours and stunning UK landscapes of the season.

Discover simple exercises to improve your skills and debunk common photography myths. Start your journey today.Also, take a look at my 5-steps-to-improve-your-photography ----------------------------------------HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHER? 1. STOP OBSESSING OVER SETTINGS AND GEARIT’S NATURAL WHEN YOU’RE LEARNING A NEW SKILL TO OBSESS ABOUT THE TECHNICALITIES, EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUES. WHILST THESE ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN BUILDING KNOW-HOW AND CONFIDENCE THEY CAN ALSO BECOME A BARRIER TO YOUR CREATIVITY IF YOU OVER-THINK, OVER PURCHASE AND OVER OBSESS ABOUT YOUR CAMERA SETTINGS AND GEAR.View fullsizeDon’t Obsess Over Settings and GearWill better a camera, lenses and other gear make me a better photographer? To a degree, all these things will help to produce better results, but with the limitation of the skill of the person behind the camera. It’s a balance between investing in the right gear and the right study.If you have money to spare then throwing it at gear, expensive foreign workshops in iconic locations may help you to build a portfolio of images. However, great photos are great because of the photographers awareness and skill not because they shot the vesting in the right gear and the right study.If you have money to spare then throwing it at gear, expensive foreign workshops in iconic locations may help you to build a portfolio of images. However, great photos are great because of the photographers awareness and skill not because they shot the image using any specific piece of equipment on a certain setting.----------------------------------------2. PRACTISE - AT LEAST WEEKLYLEARNING ANY NEW SKILL, BE IT DRIVING, PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT OR ATTENDING A WEEKLY FITNESS CLASS REQUIRES COMMITMENT AND EFFORT ON YOUR PART TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS NO DIFFERENT, YOU HAVE TO PRACTISE ON A REGULAR BASIS IN A DISCIPLINED WAY IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE.View fullsizeMonthly Photography Study PlanSchedule time for your photography into your weekly routine. Your photographic study can take several forms. Actual shoot time, editing time, sharing and feedback time, research time, class time and so on. The key to see progress is to build the practice and participation into your busy life schedule. Study time can be as little as 15 mins to a few hours or more so try to plan time to address different areas of your photographic development. See | Design | Shoot | Enhance | Share ----------------------------------------3. ASK FOR FEEDBACKGETTING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK FROM PHOTOGRAPHERS YOU RESPECT AND WHOSE WORK YOU CONNECT WITH IS AN INVALUABLE WAY TO IMPROVE. WE ALL HAVE BLIND SPOTS, TECHNICALLY AND CREATIVELY, OTHER PEOPLE’S OBSERVATIONS CAN OFTEN REVEAL AND SPOT SOMETHING THAT WASN’T OBVIOUS TO US. THIS IS ESSENTIAL FEEDBACK ON HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHER.View fullsizeCritique is better than praiseThe number of social media likes doesn’t determine the quality of your photo. It’s very easy to feel good about a photo shared on social media when you receive lots of likes and lovely comments of praise. However, these signals don’t really add much value, other than to the ego, and certainly don’t help you improve.There are plenty of online sites that you can post photos to where constructive feedback is given if asked for. I’d advise engaging with those groups where this is the aim rather than a popularity contest. The best feedback I ever receive is when someone, I respect, posts balanced and constructive feedback on my image, In fact, the observations from peers and masters has caused me to reconsider, adjust and learn from their inputs in a way I just wouldn’t have been receptive to if my mindset was closed.----------------------------------------4. READ YOUR CAMERA MANUALIF YOU’RE OBSESSING ABOUT HOW YOUR CAMERA OPERATES AND FINDING SETTINGS THEN YOUR COGNITIVE CAPACITY IS BEING DIVERTED AWAY FROM YOUR SUBJECT AND CREATIVITY. HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU BURN IN THE MOMENT TRYING TO FIND A SETTING, A BUTTON AND OPTION IN THE MENU SYSTEM? GET TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA SYSTEM INSIDE OUT IF YOU WANT TO LEARN HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHER.View fullsizeOperating Guides are never easy readingView fullsizeYou need to tackle it systematicallyCamera manuals concentrate on what rather than why. I remember the feeling of confusion and frustration when I first attempted to read a camera manual. The jargon, this button does this but no explanation of why you would use a setting. It is a bit of a chicken and egg scenario because unless you understand what “aperture is and does” (as an example) then knowing how to chang confusion and frustration when I first attempted to read a camera manual. The jargon, this button does this but no explanation of why you would use a setting. It is a bit of a chicken and egg scenario because unless you understand what “aperture is and does” (as an example) then knowing how to change it doesn’t really help when you’re a beginner.The good news is that these days there are plenty of easy to follow books and on-line guides and videos to help you understand and learn about your camera inside out. It might take you a little research to find the right medium and tutorial for you and your camera model but it will be worth every minute and pound spent if it means you get the most from your camera’s ability and features.----------------------------------------5. SHOOT WITH OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERSIF YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO ONLY TAKES THE CAMERA OUT WHEN WITH THE FAMILY OR NON-PHOTOGRAPHY FRIENDS THEN YOU WILL KNOW THE SCENARIO… “HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO TAKE A PHOTO?” IT’S FRUSTRATING FOR YOU AND THEM SO MAKE TIME TO PURSUE YOUR HOBBY AND INTEREST IN PHOTOGRAPHY WITH THOSE WHO SHARE YOUR PASSION. LEARNING WITH LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE IS ESSENTIAL ON HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHER.Don’t miss the shots you should have gotGoing out with other photographers is educational and fun. When you meet up with other photographers, either formally on an organised photography workshop or informally through a social group, network or friend, the opportunity to learn from others and have the time to consider every shot without the pressure of a clock ticking and rolling eyes of a family member targeted at your creative activity.Taking photos, which is what non-photographers do, is very different from making photos. Making a photo is about considering many elements of light, settings, composition and having a clear intention for the photo. Working alongside other photographers creates an environment where everyone is working individually with time and patience but also with the option to collaborate and share with like-minded people.----------------------------------------6. LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKESIT’S EASY TO LOOK FOR EXCUSES ABOUT WHY YOU TOOK THE SHOT WITH THOSE SETTINGS OR THAT COMPOSITION AND SO ON. ALL THOSE REASONS MAYBE GENUINE AND UNAVOIDABLE AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME. HOWEVER, RECOGNISING THE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE AND NOT REPEAT THE ERRORS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH ARE THE GOLDEN NUGGETS OF IMPROVEMENT. THIS WAS ONE OF MY BIGGEST BUT GAME-CHANGING ELEMENTS TO HOW TO BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHER.View fullsizeLearning from mistakesMake problem solving a habit. I have lost count of the amount of times I have come back from a shoot and reviewed images from the day/weekend and culled a large proportion of them. It still happens today, despite my experience, but less often than previously, which is the important point. Digital photography undoubtedly means we take/make more photos than ever before, but how many of us spend the time on the mistakes (those we chose to delete) analysing the why rather than just saying to ourselves “it doesn’t cut the mustard” but why not?Often the answers are for obvious reasons, focus point, depth of field, camera shake or subject movement, flat lighting and and array of reasons, but ultimately we decided to press the shutter at that moment in time so, presumably, had some level of control an input into the photo making process. Right?Well, yes tha re for obvious reasons, focus point, depth of field, camera shake or subject movement, flat lighting and and array of reasons, but ultimately we decided to press the shutter at that moment in time so, presumably, had some level of control an input into the photo making process. Right?Well, yes that’s how it’s supposed to work but we often chance things and see how it turns out. That’s great in my view, as photography should be free from to many rules and text-book settings. However, it shouldn’t be about shooting hundreds of frames randomly in hope that one might be good, instead of the spray approach I have found that opening up the mind to some simple principles of keeping some discipline but not restricting creativity usually yields the best returns. When i get home and review the results I always want to look and examine and analyse the failed shots as much as I want to relish the good shots.----------------------------------------7. GET PROFESSIONAL TUITIONTHERE ARE LOTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND “COMPANIES” OFFERING PHOTOGRAPHY TRAINING, JUST SEARCH ONLINE AND YOU WILL SEE THE ARRAY OF OPTIONS OFFERING YOU CLASSES, WORKSHOPS AND COURSES CLAIMING TO ADDRESS ALL YOUR NEEDS. OF COURSE, I AM ONE OF THOSE LISTINGS, BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE! I AM NOT JUST A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER WITH AWARDS AND ACCOLADES, I HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN TRAINING TO BECOME A QUALIFIED PHOTOGRAPHY TUTOR.Professional Photography TuitionLearn from a professional, not amateur. Being a great photographer doesn’t necessarily mean you are a good teacher. When I started out as a photography tuition business six years ago I thought it was simply a case of showing my work and inspiring other to join me. It wasn’t long before I realised I needed to be more than just a “decent” photographer to inspire and educate others. Over the last six years I have made education my focus. Creating structured courses, workshops outcomes and running a photography tuition business has forced me to re-evaluate how I share my knowledge and experience in a formal and repeatable way.Enrolling on a course or workshop is a commitment for the student and tutor, so ensure both objectives are aligned before you part with your cash.Just look at my customer reviews and feedback to see the evidence on how to become a better photographer.----------------------------------------REMEMBER TO VISIT MY PHOTOGRAPHY BLOG PAGE FOR FREE TIPS , INFORMATION, ADVICE AND THE LATEST OFFERS.----------------------------------------MORE FREE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS/blog-on-photography/photographing-autumn-uk-landscape-photography-guidePhotographing Autumn - UK landscape photography guide Photographing autumn: Experience the colours and stunning UK landscapes of the season.

Sign up here if you want to receive these by email Hopefully, with more downtime, you will be able to read and learn photography basics or refresh your understanding.----------------------------------------10 CREATIVE PHOTOGRAPHY PROJECTS TO DO THIS WEEKENDI don’t know about you, but being in lock-down, isolation and unable to venture out beyond the perimeter of my property is a sure-fire way to stifle my creativity. I draw my energy and inspiration from being in the landscape and outdoors amongst nature. So, when folks have asked me for ideas about what to photograph during this period, I have found it hard to come up with anything original or inspiring. For those of you who are on my RPS Mentoring Course , now is a good time to create or refine some subjects and techniques that could help your panel. Macro/Close-up, Still life, Portrait, Movement, Abstract or whatever would fit your portfolio and demonstrate different techniques and competence.For the rest of us, trying to find that “thing” that stirs up excitement and motivation is really just down to setting time aside this weekend to have a good go at something. I intend to read at least one of the many books on photography that have sat on the shelf for too long, untouched. I hope th For the rest of us, trying to find that “thing” that stirs up excitement and motivation is really just down to setting time aside this weekend to have a good go at something. I intend to read at least one of the many books on photography that have sat on the shelf for too long, untouched. I hope that I will find the motivation to pick up the camera and create again.SOME PHOTO PROJECTS IDEAS 1. ABC PROJECT There are two ways you can tackle this project. You can either choose a letter to photograph something that starts with that letter. Another photography idea is to photograph something that looks like the letter. This option is fun if you want to create a collage of photos to spell out your last name or a photograph for each letter of the alphabet. 2. WORK THROUGH A BOOK There are many books out there that will teach you different skills. You can tackle a new chapter each day. I recommend this Henry Carroll series: 1. Read This If You Want to Take Great Photographs 2. Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs of Places 3. Read This If You Want to Take Great Photographs of People 4. Photographers on Photography: How the Masters See, Think and Shoot 3. GRATEFUL PROJECT Photograph objects, people or spaces you are grateful for. Not only will you never run out of ideas of things to photograph but it helps you focus on what is really important and how blessed you are. 4. CHOOSE A SUBJECT Focus on a new subject to try new compositions and break out of your normal photography routine. Subject ideas: – Shoes – Flags – Windows – A colour – Lines – Doors – Chairs 5. SAME VIEW EVERY DAY Take a photo from a window or identical position every morning, evening or both, everyday to see how it changes in the light, weather and seasons. 6. A DAY IN THE LIFE OF Take a photo once an hour for the whole day to capture the everyday moments and routines that we often forget to capture. 7. MAKE A SELF-PORTRAIT OR SHOOT A REAL PORTRAIT OF A LOVED ONE Probably one of the hardest projects to do and feel happy with it. I am an avid selfie hater, however creating a self-portrait is actually quite challenging. Think about how you can get creative using glass/mirror reflection or other ways to portray yourself or if a loved one take the time to make a professional photo of this person and give it to them. Remember your photographing who someone is not what they look like. 8. ROYGBIV Photograph a 7 day Rainbow project. This is to take a different colour as the focus point every day for 7 days. Sunday: Red Monday: Orange Tuesday: Yellow Wednesday: Green Thursday Blu to them. Remember your photographing who someone is not what they look like. 8. ROYGBIV Photograph a 7 day Rainbow project. This is to take a different colour as the focus point every day for 7 days. Sunday: Red Monday: Orange Tuesday: Yellow Wednesday: Green Thursday Blue Friday: Indigo Saturday: Violet. 9. LEARN AND PRACTISE A NEW TECHNIQUE Panning, zoom burst, focus stacking, macro, abstract, selective focus, motion blur, panoramics… the list is endless. Pick a technique that you want to learn and master it with research and lots of practice. 10. LOCK-DOWN - LOOK DOWN It’s easy to fall into the habit of photographing things in front of us but why not try locking down your perspective to only photograph things looking down for a day? I'm just photographing stuff on the ground. You will find interesting subject matter if you look closely enough.----------------------------------------MEANTIME SIGN UP FOR ONE OF MY WEBINAR, ONLINE PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS TUTORIALS - EDITING WITH LIGHTROOM AND NIK, B&W CONVERSION, FILTERS & BRACKETING, COMPOSITION AND MORE…----------------------------------------If you want to support my business and invest something for when we return to normal working ways you can buy yourself a digital gift voucher.

Since then Janet has undertaken numerous masterclasses, workshops and had some 1-2-1 lessons.Janet, wisely, or not, decided to embark on the RPS distinctions Licentiateship in Mar 2018 and signed up for my RPS Course Janet’s first few attempts of submitting candidate images for my review were painful for us both :) with many being rejected for technical and/or composition issues. I know Janet initially went through quite a dip in confidence due to the number of rejects, but with some coercion, she managed to pick herself up and get motivated to be more considered about what level of technical, creative and post-production competence was required to meet the distinction standard set by the RPS.Her panel shows the variety of lighting, use of focal lengths, apertures and shutter speeds, essential for the Licentiateship. I especially like her still life which I know she had to really expand her editing skills to produce and the image of the canon being fired is perfectly timed for the decisive moment.A very big well done Janet, your perseverance and determination have quite rightly rewarded you with this recognised achievement and in the process made you a more competent and creative photographer. I know you will continue to develop, enjoy a ing fired is perfectly timed for the decisive moment.A very big well done Janet, your perseverance and determination have quite rightly rewarded you with this recognised achievement and in the process made you a more competent and creative photographer. I know you will continue to develop, enjoy and take your photography hobby further to even greater heights.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JANET ON GOING FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?I was keen to improve my photography skills and felt to gain this recognition from RPS a worldwide recognised photography accreditation would be a benchmark of achievement towards that goal. I still have more to learn and this has pushed my ability in the right direction for improvement.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING COURSE?I have worked with Alan on other workshops I felt his driven high standards would benefit my journey to improvement. Alan always gives you an honest opinion and has high expectations. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING CLASSES. The group format was enlightening as you learn from everyone’s journey as well as your own which was helpful. I picked up ideas of composition and tips on processing from other reviews which I incorporated into my work. I would have liked to have had a more open forum rather than what felt like a 1:1 with an audience. I feel that a combination of personal 1:1 plus the group meetings was beneficial as the 1:1 made the time to focus on specific issues. The mentoring was interrupted by Covid 19 and had to switch to Zoom meetings which were particularly challenging at the print stage, however, all were achieved with dedication and focus as in previous meetings in person. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE RPS DISTINCTIONS COURSE?The support throughout was excellent, not only from prearranged meetings but also a response to a phone call and short notice Zoom calls. Alan was even prepared to meet me at the printers for that last crucial check of my prints which proved valuable as I had to have one re-mounted. 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? I knew I was not ready for the RPS distinction when I started and remember being horrified that I might be expected to have completed my panel in less than 6 months. I had earmarked 12 months in my head from the start. My expectation was a steep learning curve which is what I needed to take my photography to a new level. I reflect on past images and can see the improvement in the composition, and better use of settings giving me greater quality in my raw files before I start processing. My post-production skills have increased many-fold and probably more so than the image capture.My personal confidence is never high so even when I watched the assessment I was sure I wasn’t going to be good enough. However, I did follow the other submissions and found myself saying “should have adjusted the shadows more on that” or “Alan would never have let me get away with that sharpness on the edge”; so I know I have learnt to be able to evaluate images better and am now transferring this critic into improved image taking.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU AP yself saying “should have adjusted the shadows more on that” or “Alan would never have let me get away with that sharpness on the edge”; so I know I have learnt to be able to evaluate images better and am now transferring this critic into improved image taking.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?LRPS Fine Art and was successful on 3/3/21 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?The assessment of 2021 done via Zoom was well organised and very informative. Full credit to RPS for achieving this. Due to Covid 19, this was my first assessment and wished I had attended one before. The panel comments were always encouraging and detailed regarding the photography and the print quality; even the quality of the image mount was reviewed, so detail is very important. As it was a Zoom assessment there were regular requests from the home-based panel for the print expert to check the tonal quality, highlights and shadows close up. I would have benefited from seeing and understanding what the panel was looking for, and recommend others do.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? Alan was my key mentor, plus I did book a 1:1 with RPS which again was a Zoom call and extremely insightful and encouraging. The assessor provided a friendly environment offering both positive and constructive criticism of my images. He recommended two amendments as well as providing helpful information on the assessment day and the pros and cons of print v DPI. Adam at OneVision for printing was extremely helpful at the final stage. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?How quickly you get there will depend on your current ability, but don’t be put off by the prospect and treat it as a journey for improvement, not just gaining a recognised photography accreditation, but personal improvement in creativity and skills. For me, I learnt to respect and change my view that the final stage is print which is an affirmation of what I want the viewer to see. Monitor settings will vary and therefore the image can be different, in print it cannot and it will be your image that is seen.Be prepared to try another genre(s) outside your normal choice to expand your knowledge. Use as many opportunities as you can to view other photographers work and evaluate their approach to develop your own. Devote specific time for photography and don’t try to multi-task with other events. I soon learnt that others, with the exception of my husband who is a cinematographer, don’t get why you can spend a couple of hours in the same spot waiting for the light.If the budget allows book a 121 with Alan (mentor) and spend time on the difficult bits. If your processing skills need developing take a Lightroom or Photoshop course , you will need more than basic skills to get to the final image. In addition, do not underestimate the commitment you will need to make to get there, but it is worth it. It also helps too if you are a little tough skinned to onboard the trials and rejects along the way, this is part of the process. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?In a practical sense, personal time was a str to make to get there, but it is worth it. It also helps too if you are a little tough skinned to onboard the trials and rejects along the way, this is part of the process. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?In a practical sense, personal time was a struggle juggling work and family commitments. From a technical view developing my post-production skills. I have had to increase my Lightroom, Photoshop and Nik abilities to enhance the images. Soft proofing for the final print, unless you have a lot of experience I would leave it to the experts. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Most definitely, I am a far better photographer for working for this distinction. It is evident if I look back over the images from the last few years. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.One other benefit I have acquired is to actually take fewer shots, but more planned ones. More focused photography reduces the editing time getting to the final selection. Above all, it has increased my enjoyment of photography and has changed me to strive to be a storyteller, not just a photographer.----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Mentoring Course .RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * COVENTRY * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

It's simply here to help you consider all the variables involved so you can make an informed decision yourself.EXISTING SYSTEM - CROP OR FULL FRAME SENSOR BODYIf you are considering upgrading your camera body from a crop sensor to full frame sensor anytime soon then you definitely need to consider whether investing in lens that is only compatible on a crop sensor body is worth it. Whatever manufacturer you shoot with (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic and so on) will generally have two ranges of lens.One for the crop sensor body and one for the full frame sensor body. However, to the best of my knowledge, all the lens for a full frame sensor body will also work on a crop sensor body. Mak ufacturer you shoot with (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic and so on) will generally have two ranges of lens.One for the crop sensor body and one for the full frame sensor body. However, to the best of my knowledge, all the lens for a full frame sensor body will also work on a crop sensor body. Make sure you check that backward compatibility before you purchase.Full frame lenses are based on 35mm sensor size so the focal length, shown in mm is what you actually record on the sensor/image.Crop sensor frames are generally 1.5 crop factor so the focal length , shown in mm is not what you are actually getting - see the following tables:View fullsizeCamera Sensor SizesView fullsizeFull frame verses 1.5 crop and 4/3rds sensor sizeView fullsizeFocal lengths on different sized sensorsAs you can see to obtain, for example, an extreme wide angle of 20mm on a full frame camera you need a crop sensor lens focal length of 13mm and micro 4/3rds sensor focal length of 10mm to give you the same field of view.Note therefore that at wide angle focal lengths the crop sensor is quite a big disadvantage as you may need to purchase something like a Sigma 10-20mm to get the equivalent of a full frame sensor focal length of 16-24mm.At the other end of the focal range, the cropped sensor focal length has the advantage (theoretically) of extra zoom - this is debatable as to whether this is an advantage when it comes to pixel quality and sharpness but it certainly will give you the field of view of 1.5 times more focal zoom. Eg. a Crop sensor lens at 125mm will give the same angle of view as the full frame at 200mm.Full frame lenses will cost considerably more than crop sensor lens - they optically far superior to crop sensor lenses, come in generally less smaller focal ranges, are made with higher quality materials, generally weather sealed and because of build quality can weigh a lot more.WHICH LENS SHOULD I BUY? - WHICH FOCAL LENGTHS DO I NEED?It obviously depends on what subjects you are likely to photograph more often than others. It's very easy to kid yourself into thinking you need a case full of lenses for all eventualities and if budget is not a constraint, or the weight and size of camera bag you have to hump around then yes, sure buy them all. However, from personal experience and talking to others you will find that over time you probably only use a couple of lenses on a regular basis.Personally, I would advise in purchasing just what you need but buying the best you can afford, thinking long term, and for those rare occasions you need a specialist or specific lens then hire it. There are many places online now that offer affordable lens hire packages.Lens for Hire Hire a camera Lens Pimp CalumetIf you use Lightroom then you may not know this but you can view all your focal lengths used across your whole library over time or selectively filter years, apertures or whatever other pointy-horned, forked-tail geeky analysis you want.Just go to the top level of the catalogue or drive your photo's are stored on. Make sure you select \"show photos in subfolders\" is checked in the library menu top navigation.Switch to Grid View and then across the top you will see a tab to select Metadata.You will then see 4 tabs - you can select any value you want to filter by across all four tabs.Example: Lens : Focal Length : ApertureView fullsizeAs you can see, it's now possible to see a count of ation.Switch to Grid View and then across the top you will see a tab to select Metadata.You will then see 4 tabs - you can select any value you want to filter by across all four tabs.Example: Lens : Focal Length : ApertureView fullsizeAs you can see, it's now possible to see a count of how many photos I have taken at any given focal length and aperture - and more besides if I want to get really geeky!My goto lenses - Which lens should I buyI use a Sony Full Frame Camera (A900 and A99) so i am somewhat fortunate, i would argue wise, that I have the option of Carl Zeiss zoom lenses. Carl Zeiss are recognised throughout the industry as one of the leading optics producers. They have an exclusive deal with Sony to only produce \"zoom\" lenses for Sony so whilst you can buy Carl Zeiss for a Nikon or Canon and so on they will only be prime lenses. (prime means fixed focal length no zoom range)So my two lenses of choice and actually pretty much for 90% of my photography are:24-70mm and 70-200mm both F2.8 throughout the focal ranges. I also have the lens extender x2 which is useful on the 70-200mm when I occasionally need more reach, however it will undoubtedly dilute the optical quality when fully extended to 400mm.These two lenses work for me as they give me wide angle when I need it and more often for me the ability to isolate and frame with more consideration and precision using the 70-200mm.The downside of these two lenses is weight and cost. They are not light given the F2.8 throughout the range and they both cost c£1500 each.Beginner's Lenses - Which lens should I buyGiven my business is about tutoring mainly beginners in photography I am naturally asked by that group of people what's the next lens after realising the kit lens that comes with camera's these days (18-55mm) really is poor quality and disappointingly soft. Most beginner's i know are not ready to part with £3k for two new lenses and want something in the interim to improve on the kit lenses but also not break the bank.My general advice is until you know which specific genres you really want to specialise in then an all-rounder lens suits most people needs. Most people meaning a bit of everything from sight seeing, portraits, landscapes, architecture, wildlife to sports. I'm am sure you can already see the weakness in a lens that can cope with that amount of variation.Firstly it would need to cover a focal range from around 18mm to 300mm and an aperture from F4 as a minimum. A lens cannot be optically at it's best when it has to cover such a vast focal range so you will notice that the ALL-IN-ONE lenses that boast huge focal ranges tend to also have poor reviews in optical sharpness and other lens distortion attributes.I would suggest something that was a compromise between the two - cost and quality. The focal ranges of 24mm to 105mm or there abouts are generally ok. Whilst it won't get you to that rare bird perched on a stick 100 meters away it will give you a wide range of focal lengths and angle of views to accommodate most of your scenarios. They will cost c£450-£500. If you really need more zoom than the 24mm-105mm provides then there are ranges from most manufactures from c18mm to 200/250mm for about the same price but be aware as I said earlier you will be sacrificing some optical quality and will notice more lens distortion.If you want to do some research yourself then I would like to point out that it's easy to find n there are ranges from most manufactures from c18mm to 200/250mm for about the same price but be aware as I said earlier you will be sacrificing some optical quality and will notice more lens distortion.If you want to do some research yourself then I would like to point out that it's easy to find people saying how wonderful any lens is just as it's easy to find many saying how rubbish it it. If you want to try and get some \"neutral\" facts then the sites I recommend are the following. Not least of which because they actually show you where the sweet spots are and where and how much each lens is affected by defraction and distortion.DP Review DXO Mark SLR GearSPECIALIST LENSES - WHICH LENS SHOULD I BUYIf you're in the marketplace to spend more and expand your lens choices then other than a couple of good zooms the following might be what you are looking for:Wide AngleUseful for architecture and landscapes * 10-20mm for a crop sensor - Sigma do a F4 version for all manufacturers at c£300 * 16-35mm for full frame sensor - most manufacturers offer an equivalent focal range either at F4 or F2.8 c£700-£1500Macro LensUseful for really detailed close-ups of anything - capture amazing microscopic detailsMacro lens are a fixed focal length (prime lens) and vary in choices from around 80mm to 110mm. The longer focal lengths are beneficial as means you don't have to be so close to the subject and can avoid casting your own shadow over the subject or spooking it if it's alive! Please note lens that are zooms with a macro switch/mode on them are not actually macro. * Typically a F2.8 macro lens at around 100mm will cost c£500-£700Zoom LensUseful for sports and wildlife. This is where it starts to get really expensive. A long focal ranger combined with a fast (wide aperture) is going to drain the bank. * A 300mm fixed focal length at F4 will be c£1200 * A zoom lens at 200mm-400mm at F2.8 will be c£4500 * A 600mm fixed focal length at F4 will be c£7000Portrait LensThe 50mm F1.8 or F1.4 has become known as the portrait lens - mainly for marketing purposes in my opinion. Anyone who has shot portraits will know that to fill the frame on a 50mm lens means being a meter away from the subject and that can be very intimidating. It's a great lens in the fact that it's an F1.4 or F1.8 and retails at c£100-£200, but in reality having owned one for many years I can honestly say I don't use it and shoot all my portraits on a range between 70-200mm.However, if you want to part with £200 for a fast lens that can be used in many situations and is not going to break the bank then it's a nice lens to own.Tilt ShiftUseful for architecture and landscapes - tilt and shift movements can be made independently of each other. This means perspective and depth of field can be controlled separately, vastly enhancing lens flexibility and ability to focus from in front of the lens to infinity. They also allow you correct any vertical distortion - seen as building leaning backwards or converging lines vertically. Take a look at this introduction article on TS PhotographyTilt Shift Lenses are fixed focal lengths and vary in maximum aperture sizes so naturally those are the factors that affect the price the most.Typically a TS lens at 24mm will cost c£700-£1500I hope this helps anyone not sure about what lens they need/want and gives a bit more insight into the many considerations there are when buying lenses.LENS C imum aperture sizes so naturally those are the factors that affect the price the most.Typically a TS lens at 24mm will cost c£700-£1500I hope this helps anyone not sure about what lens they need/want and gives a bit more insight into the many considerations there are when buying lenses.LENS CALIBRATION - ENSURE SHARP RESULTS AND ACCURATE FOCUSINGFinally whilst most lenses these days are extremely accurate when it comes to focusing where the focus point is. However you shouldn't assume that the autofocusing is pin-point accurate and it is not untypical to see a lens miss focus on the wrong subject because lens is back focusing or forward focusing.All cameras and lenses are manufactured within certain tolerances. This means that a camera or lens is considered in spec if it falls within a certain range of accuracy. Every manufacturer is different. Sometimes a lens that is front or back focusing +/-3 is considered within normal operating quality.What Is Front/?Front focusing is when the focus falls in front of your intended subject and back focusing is when the focus falls behind your intended subject.Barring user error, a lens could be tested at -2 and back focusing slightly or tested at +1 and front focusing slightly. Both are considered within the range of normal tolerance. Cameras compound the issue. Sometimes, a lens can be back focusing slightly and that is not a problem. But if it is mounted on a camera that is also back focusing slightly then you are now shooting outside the range of spec.Micro adjustmentsThe good thing about making micro adjustments on your camera is that it increases the accuracy of your focusing. Most cameras have micro adjustment options, including Canon, Nikon, Sony, Olympus, and Pentax. If your lens is back or front focusing, you can go into the menu of your camera and make it aware of this lens’ issue, however slight the issue may be.How to see if your camera has the ability to micro adjust the autofocus for each lensFor Nikon, it’s under the wrench or setup menu. It’s labeled as AF fine-tune and has a diagram showing you where you are moving the focus point. You want to only change the saved value, and make sure that the fine-tune is turned on. It will remember the changes each time you put that lens on, so you should only have to adjust it once.For Canon cameras, it’s very similar. You make the changes in the Function then Auto Focus settings, and the rest is the same as when done with to a Nikon body. Remember, though, if you have multiple cameras, you are making the adjustment in the camera, not the lens, so you need to calibrate each lens on each camera.For Sony cameras - Press MENU. Select Setup. Select AF Micro Adj. Select AF Adjustment Setting. Select On. Select Amount. Turn the control wheel to adjust the value. Press the center button of the control wheel when finished.How to correct the alignmentYou can buy a kit, such as https://michaeltapesdesign.com/lensalign.html and do it yourself or you can bring your camera and lenses to do me and I will do it for you for £25 Alan Ranger Photography Services news , photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 16 February 2021Alan Ranger Photography [http://maps.google.com?q=45 Hathaway",

      "articleBody": "HOW TO DELETE DUPLICATE PHOTOS IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC----------------------------------------DUPLICATE PHOTOS IN LIGHTROOM - YEP, IT HAPPENS - THIS GUIDE SHOWS YOU HOW TO DELETE DUPLICATE PHOTOS IN LIGHTROOM CLASSIC SAFELY.BACKGROUNDI recently supported (through an online 1-2-1 using Zoom) a client sort out his Lightroom Library and images and removing duplicate photos in Lightroom. It was a familiar scenario that I have encountered on many occasions with clients. Photos stored in different places; local hard drive, external hard drives, some in Apple Photos, some in Lightroom CC because they installed that instead of Lightroom Classic and so on. Therefore they found Lightroom duplicate photos across their libraryThe client phoned me to ask if I could help them sort it all out and get everything in one place, Lightroom Classic and organise the images into some hieratical structure. Having done that migration umpteen times, I was confident I could assist them. So after a few hours of configuring, and downloading photos from LR CC and Apple Photos we began the import of all the images and, at the same time re-organised them inside of Lightroom Classic into year and date order.As ever this produced multiple copies of the same photo “duplicates” and in this case, there were triplicates and even quadruples! This often occurs because the file names of the photos or file formats are different. i.e jpg or jpeg and so on or previous botched attempts to rescue a failed order.As ever this produced multiple copies of the same photo “duplicates” and in this case, there were triplicates and even quadruples! This often occurs because the file names of the photos or file formats are different. i.e jpg or jpeg and so on or previous botched attempts to rescue a failed hard drive or images renamed the files to a string of letters and numbers.BEST PRACTICE - HOW TO AVOID DUPLICATE PHOTOS IN LIGHTROOMI’ve said this many times before but will say it again, never change the actual file name that the camera assigns to the file. If you do you run the risk of Lightroom and other software treating it as a different image to another version of it. Lightroom provides a field (image Title) separate from the image file name for you to call your image something more interesting than IMG_25478.jpgRemember, that Lightroom and other software can’t actually scan the image graphically to identify if it as a duplicate so it relies on the file name, date and time stamp and metadata (exposure, lens, camera etc). More of this later.Try to stick to one application for your photos, trying to use Apple Photos, iCloud, Lightroom X and Y all as repositories will almost certainly create headaches down the line at some point. All of these applications expect to be the master source so trying to combine multiple applications is not impossible but it takes a lot of discipline and a very tight workflow and unless you are tech-savvy and really understand how to manage this, it’s best avoided.SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF DUPLICATE PHOTOS IN LIGHTROOM AND REMOVING THEM SAFELYAfter the initial import and reorganisation of my clients 25,000 photos, it was apparent very quickly that there were multiple copies of the same images in different resolutions, different file formats and so on. So how to remove duplicate photos in Lightroom safely without going through a long and laborious exercise of manually checking every duplicate occurrence?After some research, to save them that painstaking task, I came across several plug-ins for Lightroom to automate the identification and process of removing them. Some solutions you have to pay a small fee to use (trial versions are available) but the one I finally settled on after testing two paid ones was the free one which worked a treat and was actually better at doing what it said it would do than the two fee-paying plugins I tried.Using this plug-in meant we were able to remove 10,000 duplicates reducing the library from 25,000 to 15,000 photos and the whole process took no more than 30 mins including manually spot-checking the results.TEEKESSELCHEN IS A FAST DUPLICATE FINDER PLUG-IN FOR ADOBE LIGHTROOM USING EXIF META-DATAIt works on Windows and MAChttp://www.bungenstock.de/teekesselchen/ Before you rush off to install it and remove thousands of photos I want to make a disclaimer. I’ve only used this plug-in once for one client only and therefore I assisted them in configuring the parameters, running the scan and manually spot-checking the results before, I asked them to press the DELETE Key to DELETE from Disk! Please, please, please make sure you are comfortable with the parameters you set and with deleting the duplicates. I hold no responsibility for you using the software and/or deleting images.If you would like my assistance to help you through the configuration and process, please book a 1hr 1-2-1 online session The developer has written a tutorial and I found a YouTube video if you want to have a go yourself. You can always install it, configure it, run it to see what it throws up without deleting any images!----------------------------------------Removing duplicates in LightroomRemoving duplicates in Lightroom CriteriaRemoving duplicates in Filters----------------------------------------SIGN UP FOR ONE OF MY WEBINAR, ONLINE PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS TUTORIALS - EDITING WITH LIGHTROOM AND NIK, B&W CONVERSION, FILTERS & BRACKETING, COMPOSITION AND MORE…----------------------------------------If you want to support my business and invest something for when we return to normal working ways you can buy yourself a digital gift voucher.

      "articleBody": "TOP 10 COMPOSITION MISTAKES - GUIDE TO GREAT COMPOSITIONA PHOTOGRAPHER’S GUIDE TO GREAT COMPOSITIONAVOIDING COMPOSITION MISTAKESComposition mistakes are nothing to be ashamed of, in fact, they’re a rite of passage! The only way to grow as a photographer is to learn from trial and error. “photography is like life. You need the negatives to develop.” Ask any established photographer and they will reel you off a list of silly mistakes that they have made. Whether it is something small like leaving the lens cap on or devastating like dropping the camera on the floor, we've all been there.I've compiled the most common errors most beginners make when it comes to designing and composing a shot to help you to avoid them: In no particular order:1. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 1 - SHOOTING FROM WHERE YOUR FEET LAND!Just because you happen to stop at a certain point or notice something you want to shoot doesn't mean that this is the ideal position, height, angle to immediately take the photograph from. In fact, it would probably be a miracle if you were always automatically arriving in the ideal position every time. Where you have the chance, spend some time changing your point of view, height, angle and perspective by taking into account the light, shadows, separating objects in the frame so they don’t blend together or overlap and making sure you are maximising as many aspects of the photograph as possible.“THE EYE SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN BEFORE IT LOOKS.”2. COMP nt of view, height, angle and perspective by taking into account the light, shadows, separating objects in the frame so they don’t blend together or overlap and making sure you are maximising as many aspects of the photograph as possible.“THE EYE SHOULD LEARN TO LISTEN BEFORE IT LOOKS.”2. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 2 - INCLUDING TOO MUCH IN THE FRAME.Creating photographs more accurately describes the process of being a photographer than taking a photograph. Consideration has to be made to what the important and essential elements of the picture are. The simple principle to apply for a beginner is to keep it simple!The more you include in a photograph the more complex and potentially unambiguous the image becomes. Try starting with framing just the most important thing that you are trying to capture and only add other things as “props” to the main subject when they can justify their part in the photo without taking away attention from the main subject.“THE PAINTER CONSTRUCTS, THE PHOTOGRAPHER DISCLOSES.” 3. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 3 - NO FOCAL POINTMake it clear to the viewer what to look at first, second and third. Make sure your focal point is positioned accurately and the composition has a strong leading line, direction and balance to your subject. Placing your main subject dead centre of the frame will not allow the viewer’s eye to explore the rest of the frame. It’s essential to make sure all the elements in the frame are well positioned and support the main subject in terms of space, depth and perspective. Create each image with a sense of balance!“FOR ME, THE SUBJECT OF THE PICTURE IS ALWAYS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PICTURE.” 4. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 4 - NO CLEAR INTENTIONThere is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept – every photograph you take should inform the viewer of the photographers intention. Creating a photograph is telling a story. It has many constructs to it and reflects the vision and interpretation of the person behind the camera and their relationship to the subject. “The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera.” “PHOTOGRAPHY IS THE STORY I FAIL TO PUT INTO WORDS.” 5. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 5 - CONNECT TO YOUR SUBJECTThis is probably one of the most fundamental tips I can advise beginners to put into practise. Recording the world and subjects in it as they are seen by human eyesight does not necessarily show us anything different. In fact it rarely provokes any emotional response from the viewer unless it’s a startling image captured for journalistic purposes. So how do you turn the ordinary into the extraordinary? Try asking yourself, what do I feel about this subject? Using the one or two words you come up with in your head, focus on making a picture that communicates just those words.Imagination is a critical component, see another of my blogs on how emotion can be captured through photography.“DON’T SHOOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. SHOOT WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.” 6. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 6 - BE PATIENT – BE DETERMINEDIf a shot is worth getting it’s worth waiting for! So many times I witness beginners taking photos as if it was a fast food activity – in – out – consume – job done. However, when you go out for a special meal you are happy to take your time, enjoy the experience, relish the flavours and different courses and the company you are with. Creating photographs can, at times, be as much about enjoying the experience t food activity – in – out – consume – job done. However, when you go out for a special meal you are happy to take your time, enjoy the experience, relish the flavours and different courses and the company you are with. Creating photographs can, at times, be as much about enjoying the experience of being somewhere and experiencing something as it is getting a shot of it. More often than not I have found that simply absorbing my surroundings, watching the changing light and elements has enabled me to take that special shot rather than just any shot.“PATIENCE IS THE ESSENCE OF CLICKING GREAT PHOTOGRAPHS!” 7. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 7 - DON'T LET COMPOSITION RULES STIFLE YOUR CREATIVITYMost photographers, and indeed cameras now, show you the rule of thirds. However you can end up being in a straight-jacket and taking photos based on formula and numbers, which if you’re not careful, won’t allow the expression of your individuality. The rules of composition are a great aid for the beginner trying to move from centrally composed images, but it’s also worth always trying to break the rules to create something more interesting – if it feels balanced and natural to you then that is a good indication that it works.“TO CONSULT THE RULES OF COMPOSITION BEFORE MAKING A PICTURE IS A LITTLE LIKE CONSULTING THE LAW OF GRAVITATION BEFORE GOING FOR A WALK.”8. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 8 - FAIL TO PLAN PREPARE TO FAILDespite all the planning, research and preparation you can put into shooting at a location, sometimes things just won’t work out as you had hoped with light, weather and subject. However, I always try to give beginners two pieces of advice. Firstly always try to put in the research about timing your visit to a location to maximise the chances of getting the right conditions you want to capture and secondly, when despite those conditions not being as you had planned be prepared to change your objectives and the type of shots you can get. It’s often the ability to adapt that brings us the greatest rewards.“ALWAYS SEEING SOMETHING, NEVER SEEING NOTHING, BEING PHOTOGRAPHER” 9. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 9 - PAY ATTENTION TO THE LIGHTThe eye is always drawn to the brightest part of an image – therefore it’s important that you either position yourself, the framing of the shot and main subject with the light falling on it rather than something else. Sometimes you have to wait for the light if shooting a landscape, other times it’s simply a case of moving your position to catch the light from a different angle. In any situation the light in your photo is fundamental to drawing the viewers’ attention to the subject and can turn the ordinary into extraordinary in a moment!“IN THE RIGHT LIGHT, AT THE RIGHT TIME, EVERYTHING IS EXTRAORDINARY”10. COMPOSITION MISTAKES 10 - WATCH OUT FOR FOREGROUNDS-BACKGROUNDS AND INTRUDERSBackgrounds/foregrounds in an image need to be balanced and in context to the main subject. Sometimes you can completely blur the background to make the foreground subject really stand out in contrast and other times the background is an essential part of the image that gives the foreground context and vice versa with the background. Always check your images after taking them for anything that might distract from the main subject, be it a fuzzy background or foreground or intruders that creep into the shot from the edge of the frame. Usually, showing less is far more compelling.“A PHOTOGRAPH IS A SE a with the background.

Sign up here if you want to receive these by email Hopefully, with more downtime you will be able to read and learn photography basics or refresh your understanding. I’ll aim to make them limited to a sixty second read.----------------------------------------EDITING SOFTWARE – ADVANCED EDITING WITH NIK COLLECTIONCOLOR EFEX PRO 4 - USING FILTERSIn the previous Tip of the Day posts on Editing, I shared what software I use and how the DXO Nik Collection has been a goto plug-in for Lightroom and Photoshop in my workflow. I’ve been a user and educator of NIK since year dot and still find it meets all my needs eight-ten years on. There are frustrating elements with it, some have been fixed by DXO since they rescued it from Google a couple of years ago but the list of developments and new features seems to never get any traction and progress despite an active user forum . I am sure they have a roadmap but I’ve never seen it (its certainly not a motorway) and I know plenty of you who haven’t upgraded to the paid latest version because of the lack of new features and improvements. Hopefully, DXO is listening (Kathryn). That said, it is the best option on the market for those who are not photoshop guru’s and want an effectiv s certainly not a motorway) and I know plenty of you who haven’t upgraded to the paid latest version because of the lack of new features and improvements. Hopefully, DXO is listening (Kathryn). That said, it is the best option on the market for those who are not photoshop guru’s and want an effective and quick way to add professional touches to their images.The first thing that a new user has to learn is that Color Efex, Silver Efex, Viveza and so on all work slightly differently and use different terms for the same thing in different modules. (A hang-over from the original NIK legacy product) So a preset in Silver Efex is called a Recipe in Color Efex. Color Efex has a list of filters and Silver Efex doesn’t. None of these are show-stoppers but you take a little longer to get used to the differences.Color Efex Pro 4 is probably the best of the bunch and Silver Efex for B&W conversion from a colour RAW image. Today, I will focus my tips on Filters and their use and creating Recipes for future use. I published a list of filter definitions yesterday so take some time to get to know them and mark them as a favourite (click the star next to the filter in the list to turn it yellow) That will reduce the amount of scrolling required.----------------------------------------A FEW BASICS FIRST - FILTERSFilters * When you open your image in Color Efex it will load up the last filter used. If you don’t want that filter then select an alternative one from the list from the left panel. * If you want to add an additional filter on top of the existing filter, click on the + Add Filter. You can rearrange the order of the filters by dragging and dropping them in the list on the right panel. * Toggle the filter on and off to see the impact of it by toggling the tick box top right of the filter box in the right panel. * Move the sliders back and forth until you feel the balance and impact you want is right.NIK COLLECTION RECIPESOnce you have created a combination of filters with the sliders set to give you a style/look you can save those as a recipe for future use and to speed up the editing time next time round.So for example the image of the woodlands was edited within a few minutes because I had created a “woodland recipe” from previous images. The use of sunlight filter in conjunction with the others allowed me to go from a RAW file, first image to Color Efex using my recipe and back into Lightroom for final tweaks very quickly.On some images I may repeat the round-trip to Color Efex two or even three times. Unfortunately, the software doesn’t allow you to apply more than once recipe to an image so it requires going back to Lightroom after the first recipe is applied and then back into Color Efex a second time to add the next recipe again.Filter DefinitionsView fullsizeCreating a recipe - WoodlandsView fullsizeTwo trips into Color Efex. First image RAW, second image top is first recipe applied in Color Efex, third image bottom-middle the second recipe applied and last image on right the final image after some more LR tweaks.I will continue to add some more tips and examples in due course, but meantime sign up for one of my webinar, online photography class tutorials on Editing in NIK and Silver Efex for B&W.Editing with LR and NIK Color Efex B&W Editing with Silver Efex B&W Editing with Silver Efex Free QA Webinar To register, select from one or more of the webinars and join in at the day and time that is displayed.

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - JACKI ROSIN - CLIENT A PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEYA PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY CASE STUDYJacki Rosin first signed up photography tuition with me in April 2013. Initially she joined a 3hr introductory class and followed up with the 4 week extended beginner's course before enrolling on the on-line mentoring programme which she has been doing for 18 months now. Jackie has completed a mixture of practical workshops and classroom based tuition to improve her photo making and editing skills. Jacki has improved her ability to design photo compositions, execute the camera settings and put the final touches to images in Lightroom over the last 2 years. Her journey has been a steady one but has shown a significant step up in the standard and quality of her work in the last 9 months. Her work has featured most month's in the mentoring assignment blogs, showing she clearly works hard with each new challenge. I hope Jacki, won't mind me sharing this, and I know many people who are similar, but she doesn't always accept that her work is good enough as she has given herself a challenging level of quality to achieve, this, with her sometimes lack of confidence means that she has been pushed outside her comfort zone on a frequent basis with photography - but what better testament to the results can I make than her inspiring panel of images that she produced for the Intermediates Course and public exhibition of her work.Well done Jacki, always a pleasure to tutor and support en pushed outside her comfort zone on a frequent basis with photography - but what better testament to the results can I make than her inspiring panel of images that she produced for the Intermediates Course and public exhibition of her work.Well done Jacki, always a pleasure to tutor and support your photography and I look forward to the next stage of your development.View fullsizeJacki Rosin - Intermediates Panel of Exhibition Images----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JACKI1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER?I’d always had an interest, which I think comes from my Dad, but had only ever owned a compact camera. When I realised what you could achieve with a DSLR once it was out of the auto mode I was determined to learn how to use it to its full potential2. WERE YOU SCARED OR ANXIOUS TO START OUT?The answer to that has to be yes! Not so much in terms of learning and getting to grips with different technical ideas and managing my camera, but definitely when it came to showing my images and getting feedback from the rest of the group, which was really scary for the first few sessions.3. WHY DID YOU SELECT ALAN AS YOUR TUTOR?I attended a 3 hour introductory session and was inspired by both Alan’s images and his method of teaching, which is both relaxed and informativeView fullsizeSep 2012 - room for improvement at the start of the journey4. WHAT WAS YOUR MAIN MOTIVATION TO COMMIT TO ALAN’S TUITION?Prior to meeting Alan I had done an 8 week beginners course and had come away feeling quite despondent, in that, the group was large and there seemed to be no structure to the sessions. I really didn't feel I had achieved anything. Alan’s course was totally different. The group was small and each one of us had personal attention therefore ensuring our individual requirements were met, whatever stage of photography we were at.5. WHAT TYPE OF TUITION HAVE YOU HAD FROM ALAN? * 5 Week Beginners Course * Post Processing Lightroom Course * Several location workshops * On-line Mentoring * Intermediates Photography Course * Masterclasses6. HOW DO YOU FEEL ALAN’S TEACHING STYLE HAS HELPED DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS THE MOST?Alan doesn't beat about the bush when it comes to giving feedback on your images! Having said that, all feedback is both honest and constructive and that is the only way to learn. That, combined with a relaxed (honest!) atmosphere makes for an enjoyable learning experience with plenty of banter flying about. The odd glass of wine thrown in helps too!View fullsizeA step up in quality of composition and technical execution7. WHAT ARE THE KEY THINGS ALAN HAS HELPED YOU WITH?The main one is to have a vision of what you want to convey to others with your photograph, both visually and emotionally. Also the importance of good composition. I now take time to think about how I really want the image to look.8. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU’VE GROWN AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?I have definitely improved from a technical point of view and am happy with using my camera, which in turn allows me to be more creative with my photography. The mentoring scheme often takes me out of my comfort zone when it comes to meeting Alan’s assignments, but this encourages me to try new ideas.9. COULD YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE INTERMEDIATES PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION?A combination of utter terror and excitement of having my images on di en takes me out of my comfort zone when it comes to meeting Alan’s assignments, but this encourages me to try new ideas.9. COULD YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE INTERMEDIATES PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION?A combination of utter terror and excitement of having my images on display in a public gallery. However the opening night was great and we all had positive comments from both friends and complete strangers.View fullsizeResting - one of Jacki's emotive flower images from her exhibition panel10. WHAT ARE YOUR AMBITIONS FOR THE FUTURE WITH PHOTOGRAPHY?I still have a long way to go before I achieve the really high standard I would like to be at, but I will keep learning and practicing, but above all continue to enjoy it.11. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE OTHERS WHO ARE THINKING OF STARTING PHOTOGRAPHY TUITION OR WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING?You definitely need determination to just keep trying. I’ve hit the delete button more times than not, but when a shot works on all levels it is something to be proud of.12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS:You just need lots of enthusiasm to learn, rather than the latest camera on the market.----------------------------------------Photography Tuition comes in all shapes and sizes - you may be one of those who prefers practical or theory - you may be someone who can't attend classes in the Midlands or in the evenings. You may live abroad or just have limited time or money. Whatever your constraints remember that I can provide a varied package of photography tuition to suit anyone's needs and budgets. Learning is so much easier and more fun when done with the support of a professional and the friends you will make whilst doing it.

      "articleBody": "NORTH DEVON COASTAL WORKSHOP | WHY I LOVE HARTLAND QUAYHartland Quay in Devon has been one of my favourite coastal locations for photography. Since my first visit there, 8 years ago, in 2011, I have returned nearly every year since to run workshops on this x-rated coastline. It has a special connection for me because it’s the location that two images were taken for my first, of three that year, award-winning entries into the Landscape Photographer of the Year competition back in 2013.Landscape Photographer of the Year - 2013Hartland Quay certainly isn’t an easy terrain to access and it’s not suited to those who are a little unstable on their feet or are not able to walk and step across large boulders. However, for those who are reasonably confident the short scramble across the boulders and rocks rewards you with endless amazing composition opportunities and the chance to practise various exposure times to create wonderful water movement between the long sculptured rock formations.We normally try to include the Hartland Quay shoreline three or four times depending on weather and tide times, but there are also plenty of less hazardous areas on the beach and cliff faces if you prefer something more sedentary.View fullsizeRock Formations on the beachView fullsizeOr maybe you can focus on bigger vista shots looking over to Lundy Island or the cliff face from the safety of the beach or from the views from around the hotel where we stay.View fullsizeView f f you prefer something more sedentary.View fullsizeRock Formations on the beachView fullsizeOr maybe you can focus on bigger vista shots looking over to Lundy Island or the cliff face from the safety of the beach or from the views from around the hotel where we stay.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeSunrise and sunset light can be amazing at Hartland and it’s literally a roll out of bed to be on the beach to maximise the shooting time.If we get the right light and tide combined then Hartland is hard to beat for drama and coastal photography.View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeI am still very proud that this image is used for the pub sign (my only pub sign to date) on the cliff edge “Wreckers Retreat”View fullsizeView fullsizePub Sign with my image taken in 2011Whilst Hartland itself is a feature of the weekend workshop and will be our base we also explore other parts of the North Devon Coastline too. In between tide times, we visit nearby spots that provide a rest-bite from incoming tides and allow you to work under less time pressure and at a more relaxed pace.Sandymouth, for example, has some amazing shoreline and provides a different proposition of seaweed and rock;View fullsizeCroyde also has some great rocks that slither into the washView fullsizeSandymouthWhen the tide is out we work on using whatever light, contrast and style works for the shorelineView fullsizeCroydeView fullsizeWestward HoOther locations are equally fruitfulView fullsizeHeddons MouthView fullsizePLACESSmall Groups - Maximum 3 x All Inclusive + 3 x Tuition Only - (minimum of 3 attendees)SUITABILITYThis particular seascape workshop is suitable for those who are comfortable with stepping over boulders and rocks or happy to work on other beach areas that don’t require that hazardous journey.

I appreciate your concern and fear not, normal service of daily or bi-daily posts will resume soon enough. I know you have missed me filling up your inboxes for the last several days but I have been working on a mini-project. When I say “mini-project” that’s how it started off and like most projects it wasn’t long before scope creep became a major factor and took me out of my comfort zone of still photography, Lightroom and Photoshop into a new product for me, Adobe Premiere Pro. Software designed to blend and produce a video from multiple media assets.A steep learning curve over 72 hrs but with the help of Con McHugh and various YouTube tutorials I have managed to cobble, and hopefully “craft”, something together that ultimately brings the bluebell woodlands to you this spring. Today *Friday 24th April) was the first day of my scheduled bluebell woodland workshops (i’m glad I got the timing right again), it’s such a pity that I can’t run these as planned and enable you to marvel at the spectacle of the amazing sight of a woodland covered in a dense carpet of these blue annual shows-offs. I went there on Tuesday (21st Apr) at sunrise to record the NHS worker/singers in the woods and took a few images early morni pity that I can’t run these as planned and enable you to marvel at the spectacle of the amazing sight of a woodland covered in a dense carpet of these blue annual shows-offs. I went there on Tuesday (21st Apr) at sunrise to record the NHS worker/singers in the woods and took a few images early morning before they arrived. I don’t mind admitting that the sight of watching them sing in the bluebell woodlands brought tears to my eyes. I hope this video does that emotion some justice.VIRTUAL BLUEBELL PHOTOSHOOT WOODLANDS 2020 WITH AN NHS JUNIOR DOCTORThis video has been produced bring the bluebell woodlands you as I know many of you can’t go to them, let alone photograph and enjoy them.

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - CHRIS SHAW - CLIENT A PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEYA PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY CASE STUDYChris Shaw first signed up photography tuition with me in Oct 2013, initially, he joined the on-line mentoring programme and after some initial attempts at assignments that proved challenging for him, he soon started to show a flair for image making. Chris continued with mentoring for a year and then went onto have some 1-2-1 private tuition, attend a workshop and the Adobe Lightroom Course. By the end of 2014 he was exhibiting and selling his images produced from the Intermediates Course in a high street gallery in Leamington Spa.Chris is a testament to the proverb try try and try again... He never seems to be deterred by the fact that he knows he doesn't know how to do it all yet or that his own images do not meet the high standards he wants to achieve. Being his own harshest critique has meant that Chris has worked hard to improve and despite that he sometimes lacks self belief he never lets this become a barrier to experimenting with new techniques and ideas.In my view, his work has shown a dramatic improvement over the last 18 months and he has quickly reached the level of a proficient photographer with images that are now starting to develop into photos of personal expression and art.Well done Chris, you have been pleasure to teach and support and I look forward to more excellent images from you in the months and years to come.INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS1. Why d f a proficient photographer with images that are now starting to develop into photos of personal expression and art.Well done Chris, you have been pleasure to teach and support and I look forward to more excellent images from you in the months and years to come.INTERVIEW WITH CHRIS1. Why did you want to become a photographer?It was something that I had an interest in when I was a teenager at sixth form college but unfortunately, other things took over and became a priority. It was always something I wanted and knew I would come back to later in life so I'm happy that I'm now finding time to devote to it. 2. Were you scared or anxious to start out?Not to start learning and using my camera but definitely scared and anxious when it came to sharing my images. I have always dealt with and am more comfortable with facts and figures so doing something creative and putting yourself out there to be critiqued in a subjective environment was something very alien to me and initially not that enjoyable but I think if you can take the “what the hell” approach and let people comment, then the feedback is invaluable in getting you to the next stage. 3. Why did you select Alan as your tutor?I was referred by a colleague who had attended his intro course and he sent me the link to his website. His images were just inspiring, typically in the genre that most interested me and of a quality that I could only dream of achieving. The fact that he was also relatively local was an added bonus.View fullsizeOne of the first images I put on Flickr August 2013 – What was I thinking!!4. What was your main motivation to commit to Alan’s tuition?I was getting frustrated both with the quality of my images and also that I wanted to go out and use my camera but was lacking direction and intention of what I wanted to shoot. The monthly mentoring changed my way of thinking and gave me a clear vision of what to do. It may not always have been in a genre that I enjoy or was comfortable with but that was still so much better that my previous wishy-washy approach. 5. What type of tuition have you had from Alan? * Monthly Mentoring * Lightroom Post Processing * Intermediates Course * One to One * Workshops * Critique Masterclass6. How do you feel Alan’s teaching style has helped develop your skills the most?In the nicest possible way he is brutally honest. Sometimes it’s not what you want to hear but it’s the only way to learn. That aside he still make you feel relaxed and at ease, enjoys the banter with the groups and is not above taking on-board student comments and working with them in areas where he himself is not quite so comfortable. His love of photography and what he does is infectious to be around.7. What are the key things Alan has helped you with?Probably the main one is composition and I’ve still got so much to learn as it’s definitely my weak spot and the element that I constantly fight with!Being able to critique you own images and understanding what you have struggled to correct post process so you know what to look for next time you go out to shoot or how you should change your workflow to accommodate avoiding the same mistakes. View fullsizegradual improvement8. How do you think you've grown as a photographer?I'm still miles away from where I want to be and I think it’s easy to convince yourself sometimes that you haven’t actually come that far but if I wasactually honest with m date avoiding the same mistakes. View fullsizegradual improvement8. How do you think you've grown as a photographer?I'm still miles away from where I want to be and I think it’s easy to convince yourself sometimes that you haven’t actually come that far but if I wasactually honest with myself and less self-critical then I would probably have to accept that I’m proud of what I have accomplished in a relatively short space of time. I rarely shoot without having a clear vision of what I'm trying to achieve, my hit rate(although still poor) is definitely improving, my confidence to share image has grown and my mind set to accept, understand and absorb the critique of my images to help me improve has completely changed for the better. 9. Could you describe how you felt when you were featured in the intermediates photography exhibition?Nervous but excited none the less! I guess it goes back to the confidence to put yourself out there to share you images. I had invited friend, family and colleagues to the opening night so I didn't know how they would react but in hind sight overwhelmed by their positivity and support. View fullsizeOne from the Intermediates Exhibition – November 201410. What are your ambitions for the future with photography?Keep enjoying it, keep learning and keep improving! I have started working toward my “L” panel to be assessed by the institute which if successful will give me a formal photography qualification.I'm not at the stage yet where I want to pigeon hole myself to a specific genre as I still enjoy messing about and experimenting with different things but eventually, consciously or unconsciously, creating my own style so that my images are instantly recognisable would be great.11. What advice would you give others who are thinking of starting photography tuition or who are currently studying?Go for it / keep going! It’s so rewarding when it all comes together and you produce an image that you are proud to share.It’s also been a great way of meeting new friends with the same interest to go out and shoot with and discuss new ideas.12. Any other comments:Yeah, be prepared to be bitten by the bug and be prepared for the bank balance to take a beating – (Cost of the equipment that is and clearly not the cost of Alan’s tuition!)View fullsizeThings I currently like messing around with…. April 2015Photography Tuition comes in all shapes and sizes - you may be one of those who prefers practical or theory - you may be someone who can't attend classes in the Midlands or in the evenings. You may live abroad or just have limited time or money. Whatever your constraints remember that I can provide a varied package of photography tuition to suit anyone's needs and budgets. Learning is so much easier and more fun when done with the support of a professional and the friends you will make whilst doing it.

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHY SHOW BUYING GUIDE | PROFESSIONAL GUIDELOOKING TO GET A BARGAINWith the annual photography show at Birmingham NEC fast approaching I am getting the usual flurry of questions asking for my advice on buying.... Whilst this blog is not going to answer the specific questions on one lens Vs another and so on it will hopefully be useful to anyone who is attending the show thinking they are going to save a bag of loot and pick up a bargain.14-17 Mar 2020The NEC, BirminghamTHE PHOTOGRAPHY SHOW IS NOT NECESSARILY CHEAPER...So i am going to disappoint you now by telling you that trade shows are no longer what they used to be. The Photography Show is no exception and over the years, especially the last five years, I have noticed that the so-called \"show specials\" really are not that special at all.Yes, there are some items that can be purchased much cheaper but they are far and few between at shows these days. This is two main reasons - first and foremost the market share of equipment being sold on-line is growing exponentially year on year and the click to buy revolution has meant that companies can offer a low cost base to operate and be competitive on pricing. Secondly the cost to exhibit at a trade show is extremely expensive these days and starts in the thousands for just a 2 meter square stand so you can imagine the cost of anything larger where stock and products are part of the equation - this simple reality means it's much tougher for retail ing. Secondly the cost to exhibit at a trade show is extremely expensive these days and starts in the thousands for just a 2 meter square stand so you can imagine the cost of anything larger where stock and products are part of the equation - this simple reality means it's much tougher for retailers to discount. IT PAYS TO RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GO...My advice, over the last few weeks, to those who have contacted me asking about equipment they are thinking of buying at the show, is simply to do your research before you go to the show.3 TIPS TO GET THE BEST DEAL 1. Try to avoid the impulse purchase when you are there and make a list of specific items you want before you go. 2. Check the prices of several sites online before you go to the show so you know whether you can purchase cheaper online before you get to the show (remember to take into account delivery costs) 3. Consider the ease of returns and warranty in both purchasing online and at the showPRO'S OF THE SHOW PURCHASEThe biggest advantage of the show purchase, in my view, is that you get to see, handle, and possibly talk to someone about the item before purchasing it. However, bear in mind that the retail stands that carry lots of equipment can be 5-10 deep with people trying to do the same, so wait times can be frustratingly slow, and the person serving you may be fatigued with the onslaught of questions, deliberations, and pressure to sell quickly!There are also many stands that you can casually browse, such as Benro, Manfrotto, Gitzo, and so on, which is great if actually picking up and seeing is important—particularly useful when it comes to camera bags, tripods, and other items where weight and size are a priority.SITES TO CHECK BEFORE YOU GO...Apart from the sites listed below, it's worth also thinking about using a QR scanner on your mobile phone. Some QR scanners will give you a list of sites with prices for the scanned item so you can compare them when at the show.QR / BARCODE SCANNERS * Shopsavvy for Android & Apple phone * Red Laser for AppleONLINE RETAILERS * Camera Pricebuster - http://www.camerapricebuster.co.uk/ * Camera in the Post -http://www.camerainthepost.com/ * Amazon - Checkout my recommended products - https://www.alanranger.com/photography-equipment * Filters and filter kits then see this - https://www.alanranger.com/s/linhoff-ARP-Discount- And https://www.alanranger.com/blogs/photographic-filters-enhancing-your-photography-with-kase-revolution-filtersThere are of course many other retailers online but I have listed the goto ones, if others know of better/other sites that they have purchased from and had a good service and price then please add those to the comments section of this post for others to research.I hope this simple guide has helped, maybe it will avoid me answering another 20 emails in the next week but more importantly I hope it helps you get the best deals available either at the show or from another source.news Alan Ranger 31 March 2020Alan Ranger Photography recommended-products LinkedIn0 recommended-products LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - FRANCIS PECKHAM LRPS | RPS DISTINCTIONSView fullsizeFrancis Peckham LRPS PanelFrancis attended a residential workshop I ran in Snowdonia in July 2018. Francis is a keen photographer who regularly attends organised outdoor workshops and his local camera club in London.Having attended my Wales workshop, Francis signed up for the RPS Distinctions Mentoring Course in August 2018. He attended several group classes and undertook some 1-2-1 sessions too (mainly to try and master the IT/technical side of things) and my bluebells workshop last spring.Francis was not always easy to teach as he definitely gets frustrated over the IT but was always a pleasure to work with. His determination and effort to achieve this distinction was proven with regular 200 miles round trips and some Skype sessions to get him over the line at the first time of asking.His panel shows great variety, essential for the licentiateship, technical quality (though hard to see how good they are as he only managed to send me small thumbnails) and real a sense of place and time, demonstrating his good eye for a shot and careful composition.Well done Francis, I hope this is just the first step in your continued development and you will go on enjoying and progressing your hobby.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH FRANCIS ON GOING FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?As a keen lifelong photog ep in your continued development and you will go on enjoying and progressing your hobby.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH FRANCIS ON GOING FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?As a keen lifelong photographer, as with any hobby, I wanted to benchmark my progress, to compare my efforts to an accepted benchmark to ensure that I was making progress and becoming a better photographer.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A RPS DISTINCTIONS AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS MENTORING COURSE?Right place, right time.... I was on a field trip with Alan and the subject came up. Curiously, while there any number of photographic courses available, few instructors seem to offer distinctions mentoring. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. Living in West London, the 200-mile return trip to Coventry was often best combined with some other project e.g. poppy workshop etc. The format of a 2-3 man tutorial works well in that it is interesting to see how others are faring. Given the limited time available, it also creates motivation to have your own succinct timetable to address whatever needs to be done within your own portfolio. Its quite effective project management. When Alan prints off your panel at the end, there’s a clear agenda of what needs to be done. The other technical aspect I would highlight is that Alan is one of few photographers to have previously had an extensive IT career. Personally, I’ve always felt at home with the “artistry” of photography, but often quite puzzled by the IT aspects of moving images around catalogues, via Lightroom etc. Alan contributes a lot in this regard. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes. There’s a high level of project management going on and Alan is a clear communicator. I always felt I knew where I was ( which was not necessarily where I ought to be ! ). 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? I felt I was a reasonable photographer and “in with a chance.” Alan’s tuition is particularly helpful at imparting what the judges will be looking for and eliminating possible reasons for rejection. I’d say he is over-conservative in this regard, but that’s better than a cavalier approach!6. WHAT RPS DISTINCTIONS DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?I succeeded in getting my LRPS 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS DISTINCTIONS ASSESSMENT DAY?I didn’t go this way...8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? Yes, my camera club has a distinctions group and I also sought the advice of a former head of a regional judging panel. All very helpful in combination, but invariably a number of well-qualified people will end up saying different things, so beyond a certain point, I felt I just had to make up my own mind and go for it. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND RPS DISTINCTIONS ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?I would encourage any ambitious hobbyist photographer to have a go and see how their standard compares. I would also recommend some form of tutored process as this is way beyond the hit ‘n miss process of club competitions etc 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCT RE WITH OTHERS?I would encourage any ambitious hobbyist photographer to have a go and see how their standard compares. I would also recommend some form of tutored process as this is way beyond the hit ‘n miss process of club competitions etc 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?I use a Mac and Alan swears by his PC – that sometimes caused friction! 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Unquestionably. Now, whenever I take a photo, there is so much more going on in my mind about how I want the resulting image to look 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.I have found doing my LRPS one of the most rewarding processes I have undertaken and would recommend it to any other keen photographer. Alan is a great tutor – even if he uses a PC ( ! )----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Mentoring Course .RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * COVENTRY * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

When taking photos that require a longer exposure than you can hold the camera perfectly still for you need to ensure the camera is on a tripod or solid support and avoid any camera movement that can easily be caused by pressing the shutter down.This is why I recommend the shutter cable release. By half pressing on the button you can autofocus your camera, ready to take that all-important shot. There of course many variants of cable releases which can include timers, lights and audible signals. Personally given that I have lost, drowned and wrecked a few in my time I always opt for a simple cheap version and think of it merely as set of batteries that will have a limited life. So I always carry a spare in my camera bag too.Each camera manufacturer has a different connection type so you just need to buy one that is compatible with your camera model./photography-equipmentCanon/photography-equipmentSony/photography-equipmentNikonYou can purchase this from my amazon store , along with a number of other useful pieces of photography equipment.The Pixel RC-201 shutter cable release is a welcomed addition to any photographer’s bag.

This is his story for RPS DistinctionsVincenzo and I had never met but after a discussion and review of his proposed panel, spare images and the feedback from the advisory day he agreed to enrol in my RPS Mentoring Course but with one difference. Being London based, Vincenzo was not able to make the group mentoring sessions so instead we had six Skype sessions at times to suit his schedule.Between May and September, we held six online sessions to work through the many changes required to bring the panel, images and output up to standard. I don’t recall how many of the original panel images remain in the final panel and know that Vincenzo went out multiple times to take new photos. The first stage of mentoring was very much focused on getting the statement of intention right. Associate panels are assessed against the statement of intention as much as they are for their individual and overall technical and creative quality. I’m sure Vincenzo won’t mind me sharing that it took a lot of stripping back, simplifying and then working tightly to the brief to ensure it was right. Personally I felt that was the turning point for Vincenzo as gave him greater focus about what the photos needed to illustrate and how to present them.When Vincenzo inform ind me sharing that it took a lot of stripping back, simplifying and then working tightly to the brief to ensure it was right. Personally I felt that was the turning point for Vincenzo as gave him greater focus about what the photos needed to illustrate and how to present them.When Vincenzo informed me he had booked his assessment for October for a RPS Distinctions accreditation, I was a little concerned he would not be ready in time. Vincenzo proved my doubts wrong and worked very hard and fast to take new images, re-edit images at the same time as learning new editing skills and produce a successful panel in less than four months. Congratulations to Vincenzo for this great achievement in gaining an Associate Distinction in Documentary Photography with the RPS. I am sure our paths will cross again at some point and I wish you ongoing success and enjoyment of your photography.STATEMENT OF INTENT > My RPS Distinctions panel explores the impact of graffiti on the urban environment and the public. Born as rebellious vandalism and mostly painted stealthily at night, graffiti have now evolved into elaborated artworks created in open daylight.> > In recent years, entire metropolitan areas have changed their appearance for the better, thanks to ever present graffiti. Hence, I was keen to discover whether the general acceptance of graffiti as an urban artform has led to an active relationship by us, the public, with street art: do we ignore, engage or unconsciously blend into such colourful works?> > After months of living and breathing the graffiti in parts of London, I have tried to capture the fascinating tale of urban space repossession and the spontaneous symbiosis between street art and the public.

WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?After obtaining my RPS Licentiateship in 2002, I felt it was time, to sum up, my scattered photographic experience into a prestigious qualification.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS MENTORING COURSE?I felt that my weakest area was editing, therefore I needed to learn how to manage a workflow that would “pop” my images, still retaining their original flavour and immediacy. Alan’s portfolio on his website shows how, carefully taken pictures, could be enhanced to an artistic level, still retaining their authenticity. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. Alan has been pivotal in guiding me through editing, so important in digital photography. Having a strong and long-dated experience with film photography, I initially struggled to adapt to the new world of digital. Alan has shown me how savvy editing can transform a dull image into storytelling. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE RPS DISTINCTIONS COURSE?Absolutely yes, Alan was frank in his feedback, no messing around! 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? RPS distinction has a very high bar and the Advisory Day put me in front of the reality of lots of work ahead if I wanted to achieve success. In particular, after close analysis, I understood that editing eady good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? RPS distinction has a very high bar and the Advisory Day put me in front of the reality of lots of work ahead if I wanted to achieve success. In particular, after close analysis, I understood that editing was my biggest weakness and Alan’s tutorials lead to a better understanding of the integration process from shooting to post-production and lastly print.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?ARPS in Documentary Photography and yes, it was successful. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I didn’t attend, too stressful!8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I attended an RPS Advisory day and also benefitted from RPS online advice. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?The standard required for RPS distinctions is very high. You need to demonstrate understanding and control of the three major steps: shooting, editing and printing. Storytelling is also an important part particularly at ARPS level, showing consistency between the Statement of Intent and the Portfolio. Nevertheless, I suppose that Licentiate applicants would also benefit by creating a “narrative” portfolio. Therefore, preparation in all the above fields is highly recommended. Budget is also important to prevent last-minute surprises. Lastly, presentation is so important: I would recommend using a high-level lab for printing (unless you are comfortable with a high-quality printer at home), choosing high-quality paper and using a professional mounting service. 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?There isn’t a specific “hard” part, the entire process is demanding! If I have to pick one, consistency between intent and narrative requires lots of hard thinking. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Absolutely yes, standards required are very high, hence had to up my standards accordingly. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Course for distinctions RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTION QUALIFICATION * COVENTRY * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

I am not entirely sure how many of the original shots from her Intentions course remain in the final panel but importantly the work completed then and further development of the concept has culminated in a successful A panel a few years later.I am particularly happy with this, the second successful A panel this month, because Jacki had some bad news to deal with a several months ago and understandably wasn’t motivated to carry on, but with a little arm twisting (something I always have to do with Jacki) she thankfully continued and has now been rewarded, rightly so, with this recognition and achievement of her creative photography skills.I a to deal with a several months ago and understandably wasn’t motivated to carry on, but with a little arm twisting (something I always have to do with Jacki) she thankfully continued and has now been rewarded, rightly so, with this recognition and achievement of her creative photography skills.I am sure Jacki would confirm that sometimes having a focus when other, more important, things are occupying your mind that photography can be a great outlet.

This panel represents a combination of all three.> > The flowers are positioned as botanical specimens, but I wanted to interpret them in a creative style.> > By focus stacking certain elements of each flower and leaving some areas to fall out of focus I have attempted to concentrate attention to specific areas.> > This effect is intensified by overlaying textures in post-processing, which softens part of each image, thus giving more of an impression of a painting.> > Brushing away the textures in varying degrees retains the shape, form and fine details of each image, allowing complex structures within the flowers to be clearly appreciated> > The muted tones and pastel colours of the textures I have applied hopefully bring cohesion to the panel and a balance of light to enhance the beauty of the flowers. Word Count 150 ----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JACKI FOLLOWING HER RPS DISTINCTIONS ACHIEVEMENT1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?To be honest, I had not thought about doing a distinction, but once Alan had suggested the idea I thought that having such a goal to reach would help me develop my photography2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING COURSE?Alan has mentored me over the last few years. I respect his advice. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS DISTINCTIONS MENTORING CLASSES. The classes were very helpful in that not only did you have your own work looked at in detail but you were also able to see how others were progressing. Everyone collaborated ideas and suggestions, so there was a lot of support and feedback, not just from Alan but from others on the same journey 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Yes, definitely 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? No, but I don’t think Alan would have contemplated the idea if he didn’t think I had some potential6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?ARPS and yes. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I attended an RPS advisory day about halfway into the course and my panel changed contemplated the idea if he didn’t think I had some potential6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?ARPS and yes. 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?I attended an RPS advisory day about halfway into the course and my panel changed quite a lot as a result. I then applied for online advice when I felt that I was almost ready to be assessed. Again a few tweaks but it helped to consolidate my panel8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I attended an advisory day before my assessment, which I found really useful. I had my prints professionally printed and mounted and sought their advice on suitable papers and mounts to use. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?You have to be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort. Sometimes it’s difficult to keep the enthusiasm going, especially when images are rejected, but eventually, you will see your panel beginning to come together 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?Producing 15 images that were varied enough for the judges, but that also worked cohesively to produce a panel 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Yes. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.It’s a great sense of achievement when you pass----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my Distinction with the RPS Course RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * COVENTRY * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

      "articleBody": "IRELAND PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP RECCE REPORT | DINGLE TO KERRYIRELAND PHOTOGRAPHYIreland is famous for many things but not many of them beat the beautiful landscapes and coastline (IMO). I was asked by some of my regular clients last November to organise a trip to Southern Ireland, at first, I thought could be tricky because any workshop lasting more than 3 days can play havoc with my schedule of evening class courses. However, I love Ireland and haven’t gone there for photography before so it seemed like I should just bite the bullet and put something together. It could work out or not but regardless I knew I would enjoy the experience of going and discovering new places.I scheduled a 4 day (3 night) workshop for March 2020 so the only thing left to decide was where and exactly where to take clients. That was the difficult part because southern Ireland has so many great locations. Dingle Peninsula, Killarney National Park and areas around County Kerry had been mentioned to me a few times over the years, so it seemed a good starting point. Furthermore, I have an acquaintance from the area that I felt sure would be able to help out with his local knowledge. After an email or two, we were set to do a recce and scouting trip in Sep 2019 over five days.The recce covered over 50 locations with 1000 KM of driving between points but made better/worse (depending on your taste) of fitting in a Damien Rice concert in Cork in the middle of the trip. (BTW it was worth the effor two, we were set to do a recce and scouting trip in Sep 2019 over five days.The recce covered over 50 locations with 1000 KM of driving between points but made better/worse (depending on your taste) of fitting in a Damien Rice concert in Cork in the middle of the trip. (BTW it was worth the effort and drive/time to see him and not many dry eyes in the theatre by the end of the night)What I hadn’t anticipated when planning the Ireland Photography recce trip was: * How slow people drive in Ireland ( guaranteed that they will drive at least 25 KM slower than the limit for the road) * How many American tourists are there; how they can’t drive and how annoyingly loud they are. * Why so many B&B’s, Guesthouses, Hotels don’t include breakfast in the price or have a bar! * When the fog comes in, it really comes in! See the gallery of shots - no fog/low cloud forecast the night before! * A few random things; why so many bungalows? Why so expensive to drink and eat out? Why do slow drivers always look so happy? Why are the people so friendly and chatty? * Not too mention that it happened to be a weekend of fierce rivalry between Dublin and Kerry for the cup in Gaelic Football - so every house and car was decked in green and yellow flags! * I could go on and on but you get the idea - an English bloke trying to explain Brexit madness to random Irish people! But you gotta love the music if you find a proper Irish pub without the tourist trap!All that aside, the locations, countryside, views, quality of the roads, the local people, cleanliness of the streets and overall experience makes you wonder why you would live in England. So it’s fair to say that my romantic, idealist view of Ireland has increased as a result of this trip.Getting back to the point of the trip and the workshop scheduled for next March (hopefully more dates to follow) there really is an abundance of locations, types of photographic opportunities (vista’s, reflections, beaches, mountains, lakes, woodlands, waterfalls, castles, long exposure, short exposure, layby shoots, rock and cliff formations, sandy beaches, rocky beaches, buildings and much more…) around County Kerry. So if tide times are calculated and drive times don’t restrict, you can cram a lot in a short space of time. I visited many locations over the five days and built up a prioritised list of options covering different types of landscape and seascape photography. Due to time constraints, most of the photos I took were done (unashamedly) with my phone so I had specific GPS coordinate to plot and plan the final itinerary.After 5 days of visiting Ireland Photography locations, grabbing sample shots and working out logistics, I have a good feel for what will be an action packed but amazing variety of photographic opportunities. I will wittel down the list closer to the time based on tide and weather in March 2020 but can sya, with confidence, that this will be an amazing photography experience for any level of photographer./photo-workshops-uk/ireland-photography-workshops-dingle /photo-workshops-uk/ireland-photography-workshops-dingleKERRY - Southern Ireland Photography Workshop - Mar 2026 £1,595.00PHOTOGRAPH AMAZING AREAS IN SOUTH KERRY, DINGLE, AND KILLARNEY NATIONAL PARK ON THIS 5-DAY IRELAND PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOPSUMMARY * Location: Dingle and Killarney - Kerry Southern Ireland * Dates: Thu 5th - Mon 10th Mar 2026 - 5 D oto-workshops-uk/ireland-photography-workshops-dingle]£1,595.00PHOTOGRAPH AMAZING AREAS IN SOUTH KERRY, DINGLE, AND KILLARNEY NATIONAL PARK ON THIS 5-DAY IRELAND PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOPSUMMARY * Location: Dingle and Killarney - Kerry Southern Ireland * Dates: Thu 5th - Mon 10th Mar 2026 - 5 Days/4 Nights * Participants: Max 4 * Fitness: 2.

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - ANNE WATKINSON LRPS | RPS DISTINCTIONSView fullsizeLRPS PanelRPS DistinctionsAnne is a relatively new client who came to me about 18 months ago after not getting her LRPS for the first time of asking. Here is her story for RPS DistinctionsAnne attended a few location workshops with me at that time to improve her understanding of composing a scene and executing the technical requirements. Interestingly and probably uniquely, she had already acquired a large body of images from her many travels around the world.Therefore in Anne’s case, a lot of her time with me was spent on organising her Lightroom library to create an image library structure and ways of identifying images for consideration and reviewing and critiquing a large portfolio.Anne took on the challenge of spending more time on working on existing images to realise their potential rather than having to go out and create new ones. Her tuition was largely, therefore based around image selection end editing rather than image creation. Anne undertook several 1-2-1 Lightroom tuition lessons, and, in the process, I took on grappling with the MAC operating system, alien to me, and the use of a mouse that didn’t do what I expected with a file management system that is “less than intuitive”.Anne always had a good range of images to choose from in terms of technique and subject matter for the L panel, but as she admitted, none were the finished article. It’s fair to say that almost 99% were ju e that didn’t do what I expected with a file management system that is “less than intuitive”.Anne always had a good range of images to choose from in terms of technique and subject matter for the L panel, but as she admitted, none were the finished article. It’s fair to say that almost 99% were just straight out of the camera and hadn’t had any enhancement or correction.Over eight months, Anne asked me to help her use Lightroom to edit images and bring them up to the required standard for a panel. Anne also used her network of friends and acquaintances in the camera club circles to get second and third opinions about image choices and panel layouts, but she was always trusting to seek my final adjudication on what to be submitted,Anne has been a pleasure to work with and develop her skills over the last year. She has been fully committed, compliant to my guidance and instructions (most of the time) and I am very proud that she has reached this goal of achieving an LRPS after her initial failed attempt. I know she will continue to work on her editing and presentation of images wherever her travels take her, and I wish her the ongoing enjoyment and satisfaction that I know photography brings her on her worldly travels and sometimes with me.View fullsizeAnne RPS Hanging Plan for LRPS - click to see large----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH ANNE ON GOING FOR RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?I wanted to improve my photography in a more structured and disciplined way. I travel a great deal, and I wanted to come back with really good images, rather than a lot of poor snaps. I hoped the process of working towards a LRPS would improve my camera work, technique and composition.2. WHY DID YOU CHOOSE ALAN TO MENTOR YOU FOR A DISTINCTION AND HAD YOU WORKED WITH ALAN BEFORE THE RPS DISTINCTIONS COURSE?Before I met Alan I had submitted a panel for LRPS which was not successful. I subsequently did a few workshops with Alan and really liked his style of teaching, and when I saw that he was offering an RPS mentoring course, I felt I would like to give it another go. 3. DESCRIBE HOW YOU FOUND THE RPS MENTORING CLASSES. I found the course content and duration was exactly what I wanted. The small groups of three others gave us all plenty of time for individual help, as well having interesting discussions about each others work. The time between sessions was just right, allowing enough time to work on our panels and individual images. 4. DO YOU FEEL YOU GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL AND INPUT OF SUPPORT FROM THE COURSE?Very definitely. 5. DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE ALREADY GOOD ENOUGH TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS BEFORE YOU STARTED THE MENTORING COURSE? At the beginning , definitely not. During the course I gained more confidence, although I realised I had to really focus on the many aspects to achieve my goals. It was a journey with ups and downs, but by the end of the course I felt I had achieved those goals, but I recognise I would never have learned so much without the mentoring course.6. WHAT DISTINCTION DID YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?LRPS successful 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?A bit nail biting, although I felt I had presented a panel I was happy with. However, you never know how the judges will view it. The RPS staff were very helpful throughou D YOU APPLY FOR AND WERE YOU SUCCESSFUL?LRPS successful 7. WHAT WAS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE OF THE RPS ASSESSMENT DAY?A bit nail biting, although I felt I had presented a panel I was happy with. However, you never know how the judges will view it. The RPS staff were very helpful throughout. The judges all commented on the importance of panel layout, printing, mounting, choice of image variety and of course camera technique. I really enjoyed looking at other candidates panels.8. DID YOU SEEK INDEPENDENT ADVICE, FEEDBACK OR INPUT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE BEFORE YOUR PANEL ASSESSMENT? I attended an advisory day before my assessment, which I found really useful. I had my prints professionally printed and mounted, and sought their advice on suitable papers and mounts to use. 9. HAVING COMPLETED THE COURSE AND DISTINCTION ASSESSMENT, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH OTHERS?It was definitely worthwhile, however, I know that I would certainly not have learned nearly so much on my own, and I am not sure I would have been successful without Alan's mentoring. If it's something you think you would like to do, then go for it. With Alan's mentoring you are in very good hands! 10. WHAT WAS THE HARDEST PART OF GAINING A DISTINCTION WITH THE RPS AND WHY?Although it was difficult selecting 10 images and working on them, the hardest part was putting images together that worked well, especially as many of them were not directly related. I also found post processing a challenge as I have preferred to get things right in camera in the past, but I have learned that even small adjustments can make or break an image. 11. HAS WORKING FOR A DISTINCTION HELPED YOU PROGRESS AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?Absolutely! As that was my aim at the outset it has definitely been worthwhile. 12. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD.The last 15 months have been a lot of hard work and a great sense of achievement in equal measures, but it wouldn't have been as enjoyable or achievable without a huge amount of effort, encouragement and input from Alan.Thank you Alan for an amazing and successful journey.----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Mentoring Course .RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTION QUALIFICATION * COVENTRY * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - PAUL KIRBY LRPS | RPS DISTINCTIONS PANELView fullsizeLRPS PanelPaul Kirby has been a client for the last few years and has participated in a few workshops and courses. This is his journey towards RPS DistinctionsWhen Paul first came to me it was clear that he knew what he wanted to get from my tuition events and he has always been someone who has consciously worked hard to achieve better results.Paul is no stranger to processes and meticulous following of rules and guidelines (previous career) so to large extent he has been easy to teach, providing him with insights, tips and ideas and allowing him to take those away and apply to his photography. As ever, Paul approached this course and challenge in well disciplined, organised and methodical way.Paul had previously completed my Intermediates Intentions course and therefore, had already gained a good working knowledge of the end to end photography workflow of seeing | design | shoot | enhance | share that culminated in a public exhibition of his work. This didn’t mean that he already had a panel of images ready-made for an L panel, but he did understand what it took to produce a body of work that met the RPS’s criteria for a successful distinction award. In addition, Paul understood where he had gaps in his portfolio and stretched himself to take on new techniques to challenge himself and acquire and demonstrate new skills.In many ways, Paul has been very eas o produce a body of work that met the RPS’s criteria for a successful distinction award. In addition, Paul understood where he had gaps in his portfolio and stretched himself to take on new techniques to challenge himself and acquire and demonstrate new skills.In many ways, Paul has been very easy to mentor. He has taken on board advice and critiques and applied my suggestions for edits and interpretations without much input on the how and taken onboard the why without much support. His panel of images demonstrates a very diverse range of techniques, focal lengths and approach, so it was not a surprise to me that the RPS asked to hold on to his successful panel of images to use for their advisory days and website to show to LRPS candidates what a good panel consists of. That request speaks a thousand words in my opinion and for that fact and his successful panel I am very proud of his achievement and progression in awareness and understanding in a relatively short space of time.I am looking forward to the next stage of Paul’s development and when he is ready to take on the step of personal interpretation and innovative image making in his next challenge of an Associate’s RPS Panel.Congratulations Paul, well deserved, easy to mentor and a pleasure to see such great images from you.View fullsizePaul RPS Hanging Plan for LRPS - click to see large----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH PAUL1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?The starting point was four years ago when my interest in becoming a much more proficient amateur photographer was forged. Since then, study, tuition and practice has enhanced my ability and breadth of understanding - through seeing suitable subjects, use of camera, composition, editing and presentation.Beyond identifying personal improvements, I wanted to achieve an externally recognised standard which confirmed a broad level of expertise when judged against other competent photographers.2. Why did you choose Alan to mentor you for a distinction and had you worked with Alan before the RPS Mentoring Course?I have attended other practical and classroom-based courses with Alan who has had a significant influence on my development. In particular, he has helped me pull together several disparate strands of understanding into a much more complete approach to photography.Being familiar with Alan’s style of tuition and support made enrolment on his RPS Mentoring Course an easy decision.3. Describe how you found the RPS Mentoring Classes. The sessions are very relaxed and friendly, with benefit in attending with up to three other delegates. The general review process and critique (of all the delegates work) was very focused and helpful in understanding exactly what was required. The small group allowed for in depth discussion around technical and creative issues which added value when considering your own submissions. Session duration was good; so too the interval between sessions to allow time to develop and improve images.4. Do you feel you got the right level and input of support from the course?Yes5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? Before the course – NoDuring the course – Not until the final sessionsAfter the course - Yes6. What distinction did you apply for and were you successful?LRPS – successful7. eel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? Before the course – NoDuring the course – Not until the final sessionsAfter the course - Yes6. What distinction did you apply for and were you successful?LRPS – successful7. What was your experience like of the RPS Assessment Day?On the day itself, it was a good experience (although slightly nerve wracking). The RPS staff are very friendly and supportive and the assessment process (of 25 panels in my case) interesting and informative.But there are some important considerations before the day:· Paying a lot of attention to presentation (selection of paper and mounts)· Submitting to an RPS pre-assessment online or Advisory Day· Ensuring that images and associated submission paperwork arrive at RPS at least 14 days before assessment 8. Did you seek independent advice, feedback or input from anywhere else before your panel assessment? Before the final mentoring session, an RPS online assessment was requested. This required the provisionally selected 10 panel images to be forwarded, together with 5 spares, for assessment by one of the RPS judges. Comprehensive and very helpful feedback was received by email in less than a week.Advice was also sought from Permajet about paper selection to ensure that all the panel images presented well on a single paper. A one-to-one with one of their representatives was very helpful. 9. Having completed the course and Distinction Assessment, what advice would you like to share with others?In selecting images, it is easy to introduce a personal bias towards your favourites without necessarily considering flaws or technical benefits.An independent and sometimes robust critique adds valuable input to ensure that both image selection and presentation of panel as a whole is as good as possible. 10. What was the hardest part of gaining a distinction with the RPS and why?While it was challenging to select the very best individual images, the hardest part of the process was compiling the panel to ensure that images were complementary, balanced in colour, tone and composition, and sufficiently diverse to demonstrate a range of photographic skills and techniques.At the RPS Assessment, the judges paid a good deal of attention to the panel presentation as a whole (including use of paper and mounts), before examining individual images in considerable detail.An interesting comment made by one of the judges was their interest in distinguishing between photographers who simply ‘take’ photographs from those who ‘make’ an impressive composition.11. Has working for a distinction helped you progress as a photographer?Yes – compared with four years ago, I am ‘taking’ far less photographs now but my success rate in ‘making’ decent compositions is much better.12. Any other comments you would like to add.Thank you Alan for all your help and support.----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize Vi VKV/01+Craster.jpg]View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining a distinction with the RPS I can support you with my RPS Mentoring Course .RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR ASSESSMENT * COVENTRY * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.

Being a witness to her going for RPS Distinctions was a journey for us both.It’s fair to say that Joyce has just about engaged in every form of tuition with me and often rebelled against my advice to become more organised and at least try to follow my methodical/considered approach in most aspects. In many ways, despite many moments of crying, but usually laughter between us, her maverick ways have helped her to explore the multiple ways of doing something but discovering through perseverance and repetition that sticking to the outcome still gets her there in the end.Joyce is certainly not a technical purist and is very happy to see what turns out so, it was a long battle to convince her to go for her LRPS Distinction. The formality, “stuffiness” and discipline required to put a panel of individual images together that combined into a coherent panel, showing diversity of technique but consistency of competence is not something that came easy to her. Firstly it meant she would need to organise her image library, I can assure you that this is not Joyce’s way of doing things. Secondly she would need to re-work images that she was once happy with. Thirdly she would need take new images to fit into the panel rather than just take a picture because she liked something.Her initial RPS cl nise her image library, I can assure you that this is not Joyce’s way of doing things. Secondly she would need to re-work images that she was once happy with. Thirdly she would need take new images to fit into the panel rather than just take a picture because she liked something.Her initial RPS classes with me were a bit of a jumble sale approach (what about this one x 100 and of course her personal favourites) which meant that after sorting and filtering to create shortlists she had to return to the originals to embark on re-editing photos that for her were already done and dusted. Needless to say there were a few iterations required but as Joyce stuck to the task in hand and after less than 12 months and six classes had a draft panel ready for assessment and presentation.Her hard work, and often reluctant, but final conformity has led to her producing a panel of images that were not only successful for the LRPS Distinction but in my view have made her a better photographer.Joyce now recognises more about composition, technical execution, editing and final presentation than she ever did before as a result of doing the RPS Distinction Mentoring Course. In a nutshell, the journey of achieving the RPS Distinction has consolidated the years of input, nagging, mentoring and critiquing from me in six months that I had failed to get to her apply consistently in the previous five years.Joyce has now set herself a new benchmark and raised the bar so I hope (should i say optimistically pray for) that she will now apply the same effort and standards to her ongoing photography and journey.I am very proud of her achievement, progression and final acceptance of “sometimes it pays to keep re-working something until it’s as perfect as can be”.View fullsizeJoyce RPS Hanging Plan for LRPS - click to see large----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JOYCE GOING FOR HER RPS DISTINCTIONS1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO GAIN A DISTINCTION WITH THE ROYAL PHOTOGRAPHIC SOCIETY (RPS)?It seemed a good next step in my progress towards improving as a photographer – however when Alan first suggested that I should go for it I wasn’t sure that I wanted to as I lacked confidence in my ability and I knew it was going to take a lot of time and commitment. I wasn’t sure that I was up for the challenge!2. Why did you choose Alan to mentor you for RPS Distinctions and had you worked with Alan before the RPS Mentoring Course?Yes, I knew Alan well. He has mentored me for a number of years now. I trust him.3. Describe how you found the RPS Mentoring Classes The classes were invaluable in building my panel. I enjoyed the collaboration but also valued the flexibility to leave early if you had other commitments e.g family. I got exactly what I needed from the input – especially as I grew more familiar with the requirements of LRPS and appreciated how the input was tailored to fit with them 4. Do you feel you got the right level and input of support from the course?Yes definitely 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain RPS Distinctions with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? I trusted Alan not to put me in for something that was beyond me. I was relieved when my panel started to come together as there was a point when I felt a bit all over the place -ie I had a stack of random images but no shape / flow. Then suddenly it came together in rather a eureka moment. I am interested to see whethe put me in for something that was beyond me.

Then suddenly it came together in rather a eureka moment. I am interested to see whether it is the same if / when I put together an A panel. Hopefully, I’ll have more of a sense of what I need earlier in the process. 6. What RPS Distinctions did you apply for and were you successful?LRPS - yes 7. What was your experience like of the RPS Distinctions Assessment Day?I was ridiculously nervous! Everyone seemed to be.In the event it was incredible positive and affirming. I was so pleased I’d gone in person as the feedback was really nice to hear. If you don’t actually attend you just get the certificate. 8. Did you seek independent advice, feedback or input from anywhere else before your panel assessment?I attended an Advisory day – again this was a positive experience. It confirmed that I was just about ready for submission 9. Having completed the course and RPS Distinctions Assessment, what advice would you like to share with others?Be prepared to put the time and effort in.Accept that many of your images will be rejected during the process of building a panel that worksTake advice 10. What was the hardest part of gaining a distinction with the RPS and why?The sheer effort of building an effective panel – it is quite a challenge 11. Has working for a distinction helped you progress as a photographer?Oh yes definitely – and it’s given me a benchmark for the future 12. Any other comments you would like to add.Massively satisfying when you do pass!

This environment was a market and therefore in public view. However one particular member of the public took strong offence to the lens being pointed in their general direction (although as it happens they weren't actually in the shot) Anyway what followed was a rather heated fracas between said member of the public, the photographer and then the Police.photographers rights in the UK/s/photographersrights_UK.pdfClick to download this printable pocket guide on photographers rights in the UKTHIS BLOG POST IS TO TRY AND ANSWER THE MAIN QUESTION OF PHOTOGRAPHERS RIGHTS IN THE UK WHAT CAN THE POLICE DO AND WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL(S) BEING PHOTOGRAPHED?Its important to state right up front that I am not a qualified legal person and can not be responsible for the legal accuracy of the information provided. I have used reliable sources to check the validity of the current legal position but the information provided is of general nature and not intended for legal advice.It is also very important to respect the liberty and rights of each person and situation and my overriding general advice to photographers is - if you get into a difficult situation then its best to defuse it and unless the shot you have taken is of general nature and not intended for legal advice.It is also very important to respect the liberty and rights of each person and situation and my overriding general advice to photographers is - if you get into a difficult situation then its best to defuse it and unless the shot you have taken is worth arguing over it sometimes better to just delete it and walk away rather then to educate the people involved, this includes police officers, officials and the public.So here are all the basic questions covered but i would also refer to a great article, without prejudice, that a more extensive explanation of what are photographers rights in the UKARTICLE BY LINDA MACPHERSON ON PHOTOGRAPHERS RIGHTS IN THE UKFacts in summaryWhere can I take photographs? * everyone has the right to photograph in a public space * shopping centres are private property and therefore the owners can impose restrictions and bans on taking photographs whilst on their property. * you can however take photos of private property, ie shopping centre, if you are standing on the public highway. The exceptions to these are military institutions and some national/royal spaces. * you can take photographs in public parks but some local authorities can impose restrictions on these too. * be aware that if you are causing an obstruction on the public highway to photograph something this could, unlikely though, to get you into a conversation with the police. Common sense usually prevails, ie don't set your tripod up the public footpath or in the road when its busy and likely to cause an obstruction and generally speaking you will just be asked to move on.Who can i take photographs of? * In UK law there is no specific right to privacy in public places. The European Convention on Human Rights gives a 'right to private and family life' * In UK law you do not have a right to privacy in a public place. * therefore you do not need the permission of someone to take their photograph if you are standing in a public space - however i advise caution here - if the photograph is of a family with said children then be sensitive to this as the law is a little more vague when it comes to infringement of \"reasonable expectation to privacy\" even when in public space. My advice is ask permission. * if you intend to use the photograph for publication, commercial use or stock photography then you need a signed model release. * photographs of people may also be the subject of the data protection act which controls the processing of \"personal data\" that is data relating to an individual from which an individual can be identified - this is again a grey area and whilst there has not been a court case to determine whether a photograph of someone without any identifying information would be caught by this act the advice is to be aware this. * photographing children under the age of 16. Whilst it is not illegal to photograph children in public spaces it will certainly draw the attention of parents, other adults and the police so its advisable to get at least the verbal consent from the parents at least first. Many local authorities and organisations have strict child protection policies in children's sports and other activities and have rules about photography at events so it is worth enquiring about the policy before attempting to take photographs even if you are the parent of the child involved. * you cannot photograph someone (using a long lens for example) from a pub policies in children's sports and other activities and have rules about photography at events so it is worth enquiring about the policy before attempting to take photographs even if you are the parent of the child involved. * you cannot photograph someone (using a long lens for example) from a public space of them in a private place, such as their home, without their consent. This is an invasion of privacy even though the photo is taken from a public place.What are my rights when challenged? * read the list above and know it well enough to be able to talk to the person challenging you - do not argue it as legal authority simple explain you understand your rights to be... * if some one claims being photographed is harassment then point out the following - just because you have photographed someone (in a public space) and they didn't want to be photographed doest make it harassment. Harassment is essentially behaviour that causes another person alarm or distress and it refers to a course (course means at least two occasions) of conduct not a single event. If a photographer stalks a person to get a photograph of them or repeatedly thrusts a camera in their face this might be harassment. * If challenged remain polite and calm. * You are not required to give any personal details unless you are being arrested by the Police. * No one, including the police, have the right to delete your images or force you to delete your images - however sometimes this may be the simplest way to defuse a situation if the photos are not that important to you. * No one has the right to confiscate your camera or equipmentRemember photography is not a crime!In most situations that arise, things can easily be placated with an explanation of what you are doing and what your intended purpose of the photograph is for. If you seek permission first then you are less likely to have issues. Where that isn't feasible or desirable then just be sensitive to individuals and know the facts but remain calm and polite and decide yourself if the image is worth the aggravation of debating things.PLEASE LIKE AND SHARE THIS POST PHOTOGRAPHERS RIGHTS IN THE UK IF YOU FOUND IT USEFUL USING THE SHARE LINK BELOW----------------------------------------MORE FREE PHOTOGRAPHY TIPS/blog-on-photography/photographing-autumn-uk-landscape-photography-guidePhotographing Autumn - UK landscape photography guide Photographing autumn: Experience the colours and stunning UK landscapes of the season.

      "articleBody": "CREATIVE PHOTO EDITING MASTERCLASS | PROFESSIONAL TUITIONCREATIVE PHOTO EDITING MASTERCLASS\"TO DATE, THIS WAS THE MOST INSPIRING SESSION I HAVE ATTENDED SO FAR AS IT BROUGHT SO MANY THINGS TOGETHER FOR ME.\"> Con McHugh 9th Jan 2018Con and Janet have been regular clients for a while now, so it was a real privilege to have them attend my Creative Editing Masterclass earlier this week. They have both got to grips with basic editing in Lightroom and doing the \"hygiene\" edits to photos but were both looking to take their editing to the next stage. As Janet remarked to me at the start of the class, \"I know what I want to do, but just don't know how to do it, my images don't look like others I see.\"The first half of the masterclass we discussed many concepts around visualisation, understanding what you want from an image and bridging the gap between critical analysis of an image to artistic and individual interpretation. The latter is always the hardest part for many as there are endless choices to be made, let alone endless ways and methods of producing it.The creative editing masterclass tries to help bridge that understanding and what with the how. We use a mixture of Lightroom and NIK software to help an image realise it's potential in whatever way the photographer interprets it.The second half of the class we used attendees images to discuss the \"hygiene\" alterations which included crops, exposure adjustments and tone curves to prepare the image for fur re of Lightroom and NIK software to help an image realise it's potential in whatever way the photographer interprets it.The second half of the class we used attendees images to discuss the \"hygiene\" alterations which included crops, exposure adjustments and tone curves to prepare the image for further edits in NIK or Photoshop.As I explained on the night, the toughest part of the creative process is in the editing. I've seen many a good shot in camera from clients, not realise it's potential due to either lack of experience and knowledge of using the right tool for the job and/or just not having a clear idea in your head before you process of how you want the image to look and feel.CREATIVE PHOTO EDITING * A. Imitate Learn to use the instrument competently. The Mechanics of it * B. Assimilate Make choices about the subject matter, genre, and personal style. The Reason for it * C. Innovate Develop a body of work that ties together your own vision. The Personal Execution of itThe analogy doesn't just apply to composition and making the image in camera but also to what and how you process an image in Lightroom, Photoshop or any other tools at your disposal.The Creative Photo Editing Masterclass focuses attention on \"what do you want your image to look like and say\" and then through consultation, we go through the editing process step by step.Janet and Con were both asked to bring five images each along to the class. The original image and the version they had edited. Based on these two comparisons we took the image through a series further edits to bring out elements that they felt were lacking or wanted further input on.\"ATTENDED A MASTERCLASS ON CREATIVE PHOTO EDITING WHICH WAS EXCELLENT. ALAN PROVIDED BOTH TECHNICAL AND ARTIST GUIDANCE TO HELP DEVELOP MY PHOTOGRAPHY.\"> Janet Boulter 9th Jan 2018Here is a sample of the before and after - so you can see how, with this class, we were able to take the image closer to how the photographer intended it and wanted it to look.----------------------------------------View fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeIf you would like to learn either the basics of Lightroom or the next stage of more creative photo editing then take a look at my upcoming courses and masterclasses and get yourself booked in.----------------------------------------lightroom , photography-courses , student-photos Alan Ranger 11 February 2019Alan Ranger Photography masterclasses , editing-photos LinkedIn0 Pinterest0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "HOW TO MAKE IMAGES THAT ARE MOVING | MOVING PHOTOGRAPHSMOVING PHOTOGRAPHSMaking images that show movement has always been a fascination for me. From the outset of my photography interest, I was often amazed at how the camera could show things that we can't experience in the same way with our own eyes. When we think about what photography actually is, then I am sure many of us will use different terms and explanations as to what it means. However, for the vast majority of people photography is simply a method to \"capture\" and record moments in time for whatever purpose. My own childhood memories of using my Dad's film camera on school trips was exactly for this reason, to take some pictures of where I had been and who I was with at the time, so that I could look back and be able to remember with more detail than my brain could recall.It was only later in life that I began to question then understand that perception was a distortion, and we are all surrounded by this simple truth that photos were both an opportunity to recall but also able to influence and convey some level of altered reality.I spent some time researching the differences, and can without hesitation, recommend that you don't do this unless you really do like and understand science. The simple facts are that the human eye and the camera operate very differently so it's actually hard to come up with a definitive comparison that simplifies all that biology vs technology stuff. On top of tha on, recommend that you don't do this unless you really do like and understand science. The simple facts are that the human eye and the camera operate very differently so it's actually hard to come up with a definitive comparison that simplifies all that biology vs technology stuff. On top of that, Googling for answers also produces a myriad of opinions, explanations and answers that vary considerably.So in simple terms and for the purposes of teaching beginners and for use in this blog post I will use the following conversions that seem to be broadly agreed upon by the people in white coats.APPROXIMATE CAMERA SETTINGS TO MATCH HUMAN VISION: Bear in mind, depending on numerous factors including ambient light, subject-to-eye distance, as well as the health and age of the individual, impacts the range of the scale. * Focus - Aperture/Depth of field - F2.8 to F8 * Time - Shutter speed/Exposure Time - 1/30-1/100 * Perspective - Angle of View - 43mm on a full-frame sensor, 27mm on a 1.6x crop sensor * Dynamic Range - eyes can see anywhere from 10-14 f-stops of dynamic range, which definitely surpasses most compact cameras (5-7 stops), but is surprisingly similar to that of digital SLR cameras (8-11 stops).Ok, so now we have the science bit out the way, we can, in essence, draw the conclusion that if we use an exposure time longer (slower) than 1/30 of a second we will be showing the time element in a way that our eyes don't witness the scene, and this is also true if the exposure time is shorter (faster) than 1/100.View fullsizeGreat, now we can easily start to make images outside the range of 1/30 to 1/100 to show movement in a way that is different to human perception. Let's start by having a look at a couple of basic examples using exposure times to freeze and blur motion:Fast exposure - Freezing motionView fullsizeLeader of the pack - ISO800 | F3.2 | 1/800 | at 70mmAs you can see from the exposure settings used for this photo of a mud runner the time dimension was faster than human perception at 1/800 so whilst we don't question the sharpness of the perfectly frozen man leading the pack, your own eyes in that moment would not have been able to see it this way - you would have witnessed a blur around the arms/legs/shoulders and so on.View fullsizeIncoming - ISO200 | F4 | 1/1250 | at 100mmAgain, the human eye can not see this exact moment with the bee sharp in this way.----------------------------------------Long Exposure - Blurring motionView fullsizeISO100 | F11 | 1/13 | at 100mmView fullsizeISO200 | F16 | \"25 | at 100mmThese two images were taken at Charlecote National Trust to demonstrate to a client how the eye perceives time and how the camera can distort that to show the same scene very differently. The second exposure was made within seconds of the first and aperture was adjusted and a 6 stop neutral density filter added in front of the lens to extend the exposure time to 25 seconds.View fullsizeCoventry Night Shoot - ISO200 | F11 | \"20 | at 26mmIf you would like to read more about using neutral density filters, what they are and what to buy then read my previous blog post here: Using ND Filters & Know your camera filters KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER - MOVING PHOTOGRAPHSLong exposure photography became very popular for a few years when Lee Filters intro ost here: Using ND Filters & Know your camera filters KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER - MOVING PHOTOGRAPHSLong exposure photography became very popular for a few years when Lee Filters introduced the 10 stop ND filter, known as the \"Big Stopper\". Images were being churned out at every opportunity to use the light reducing filter and for a while I guess they presented something new and different. However, like most new fads it became all too common and soon lost it's impact as more and more images were made purely for the impact of a long exposure without any consideration of why and so on.Point 1 - use long exposure or short exposure to convey your intention for the image - shooting just to show a technical process used, sharp or blurred, doesn't make a good enough reason in my opinion.Point 2 - evaluate subject/scene to consider what is already moving and what remains static. You often do not need to add filters to capture movement and motion. Experiment with your exposure settings (ISO,Aperture,Shutter) in the available light with the speed of subject movement until you get the right combination you are looking for.View fullsizeLundy Set - ISO200 | F14 | \"4 | at 35mm - No ND filtersRemember you will probably need to have several attempts to get the result you want. Both these moving photographs were taken with no filters, just experimentation with exposure times.View fullsizeDancing - ISO200 | F8 | \"1 | at 200mmView fullsizeRush Hour - ISO400 | F27 | 0.7 | at 70mm with 0.6 ND FilterPoint 3 - There is nothing worse than a sharp image of a fuzzy concept is something you will have heard me say in my classes. Sharpness, in my view, is very overrated. My own thought is that our need for sharpness, particularly in photography, stems back to our early childhood days of seeing photographs of family members, in that context sharpness is probably important in order to distinguish them and see details about them. Unfortunately the legacy of experiencing those photos seems to have naturally transferred to all photographs for most people and we have an expectation that a good photo first of all needs to be sharp and in focus. Any deviation away from this tenet makes people uncomfortable and it's harder for them to express acceptance, pleasure or judgement on the image without first questioning their intellectual prejudices, which they generally don't do.The degree to how sharp parts, or all, of your image is should be a conscious considered decision, not one that occurs because that was the mechanical outcome of the camera and available light with the exposure settings you dialed in. Of course this may be where your first test shots start but the photographer will then go onto experiment, make adjustments and repeat until they are satisfied that the concept is clear and sharpness occurs only where it is wanted and to the degree they require it.----------------------------------------INTRODUCING UNNATURAL MOVEMENTICM (intentional camera movement) is nothing new in photography technique and has been a populist style for over a decade. There are several methods of camera movement. Let us discuss them each in turn.Moving the camera during the exposure to cause all parts of the subject and scene to be rendered blurred. This style fascinates me as can be used to produce a very ethereal feel to an pulist style for over a decade. There are several methods of camera movement. Let us discuss them each in turn.Moving the camera during the exposure to cause all parts of the subject and scene to be rendered blurred. This style fascinates me as can be used to produce a very ethereal feel to an image. It takes some practise as when not quite right it just looks like camera shake, therefore the amount of movement of required is essential to get right, in your opinion.Panning - Vertically and horizontally in a straight lineThis technique works well where there are lines in the composition, it's natural to move the camera in the same direction as the lines.View fullsizePoplars - ISO100 | F29 | \"1 | at 100mm No filtersThis was a vertical pan of reflected poplar trees at Brandon Nature Reserve. I used the small aperture of F29 to get a long exposure of 1 second.View fullsizeSurf Pan - ISO50 | F64 | 1/8 | at 400mm No filtersThis was a horizontal pan of the wave crashing onto the shoreline - In this example I moved the camera from left to right at the same time as taking the photo, trying to ensure that my horizontal movement was at the same pace as the incoming wave.Random movement of the camera - moving photographsIt's not just a case of simply jiggling the camera around, though essentially that is what you are doing; you'll need to experiment with how much \"jiggling\" works and for how long to jiggle for. Simpler compositions seem to produce better results with this technique as it's easier to still identify subjects and contrast without it just looking like you dropped the camera.Play around with how much movement and for how long you move the camera too. For example you could go for a 5 second exposure and not move the camera for the first 4 seconds of the exposure and just the last second.Fern Arch - ISO100 | F22 | 0.7 | at 200mmChris Friel and Doug Chinnery use these techniques really well among others, so do some research and look at their work for ideas and inspiration but remember ultimately decide on how much works for you.Multiple ExposureWhilst not strictly movement there is of course movement because the image is blended from more than one exposure each time moving the camera to adjust the composition. Valda Bailey and Chris Friel are, in my view, the masters of this technique. Valda really uses colour and texture to emphasise her compositions, often abstract but usually intriguing to the viewer.This technique requires a camera body that automatically allows for multiple exposures otherwise you will need to just do your own blending of single exposures in photoshop.It may seem random but am I am sure if you study Valda's work then you will see it is anything but random. Clearly it takes a lot of practise and careful understanding of your subjects to make this work well.View fullsizeOne of my early attempts at multiple exposure, of a wild meadow and then over layed with a water reflection.View fullsizeWoodland Arch - ISO200 | F13 | 0.7 | at 70mm & ISO200 | F16 | 1/30 | at 70mmIn this image I took two exposures. The first was a straight sharp shot of everything the second a vertical pan shot. The two two exposures were then blended with masks in Photoshop to keep the foreground tree trunks from the sharp image and the background trunks from the panned image.Radial Blur/Movement - moving photographsFinally but no means least is moving the zoom ring on the camera. Eit tical pan shot. The two two exposures were then blended with masks in Photoshop to keep the foreground tree trunks from the sharp image and the background trunks from the panned image.Radial Blur/Movement - moving photographsFinally but no means least is moving the zoom ring on the camera. Either forwards into the frame or backwards out of the frame. Both have a radial zoom effect in your image and it's something most beginner's try a few times for a \"novel\" effect but then quickly move on.View fullsizeTree Zoom - ISO100 | F22 | 0.6 | Zoom burst 16 to 35mmI hope this gives you a few ideas and shows just how much opportunity there is to use movement in photography. There are always plenty of opinions to be heard about what works and doesn't but ultimately you are the only judge of your image.I heard a quote a while ago (can't recall where and who) that echoed my approach to photography - \"photography should mirror your feelings, abstracted from reality, excised from context and made to be restaged in a theatre of just one. The theatre, the author's mind and heart but a safe place to play out the scene knowing the curtain can fall anytime to end the performance.\"In our world of constant scrutinisation and examination of technique and method it's often easy to forget why we got into photography in the first place. That basic enjoyment we get from experimentation and making images that appeal to all parts of our personality are surely one of the great things about this art. So go out there with your camera, play and have fun with it and don't worry whether it conforms to how images should be made - you will find the right balance for you right now and that's all that matters.photography-tips Alan Ranger 15 August 2018Alan Ranger Photography tips LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "SUFFOLK PUNCH - A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE & BACKGROUNDSUFFOLK PUNCHSUFFOLK ROOTSI was educated (or not) in Suffolk as my parents moved there from south London when I was young. Therefore, Suffolk is the place I, partly, grew up in and have fond memories of. Part of my family still resides there, Ipswich and Felixstowe and being brought up there meant my loyalties regarding football have remained firmly attached to Ipswich Town. I held a season ticket with ITFC for several years despite moving to Coventry at eighteen and made numerous trips to the ground from Coventry (2.5hrs each way) to suffer frequent disappointment, with the occasional rush of success. Like most footy fans that's par for the course and eventually with the astronomical rise in ticket prices and the over-commercialisation of football, brought about Sky television I quickly became despondent about the time and cost to go to games. By the time I reached my mid 30's (a few years ago!) I lost the appetite for the game and what used to be a passion, which coincidentally was replaced with the love of photography. Interestingly the experience and outcomes are broadly similar - many disappointments and the occasional rush of satisfaction but also a lot of miles travelled and an expensive pursuit.I'm not sure that these two events are connected other than to say the love of Suffolk has not waned over the years. It's interesting that it doesn't feature much as a location for landscape photographers e occasional rush of satisfaction but also a lot of miles travelled and an expensive pursuit.I'm not sure that these two events are connected other than to say the love of Suffolk has not waned over the years. It's interesting that it doesn't feature much as a location for landscape photographers. Then when you consider the variety and choices we have in the UK to photograph the outdoors and landscape it doesn't take much to work out that we are totally spoilt for choice. Devon, Wales, Lakes, Northumbria, Scotland, Dorset to name a few and of course with the nearest neighbour, Norfolk , and particularly North Norfolk it's easy to see why so many haven't explored the Suffolk coast and countryside yet.SUFFOLK JEWELSPhotographically speaking my experiences in Suffolk have largely been based on family trips back home, thus I have never made proper time to consider, create and explore this area beyond family walks and limited time in any location. However, inspired by the work of Lee Acaster and Justin Minns and my own knowledge of the potential I recently organised a workshop there. In a somewhat fortunate way, the workshop didn't attract full participation which enabled me to go knowing that I would have an element of personal time to create as well as provide clients with what they wanted, sorry I meant needed!----------------------------------------LIGHT IN LANDSCAPESLandscape photography is always challenging due to the variable nature of light and weather so facing three days of bright blue skies, sunshine and harsh lighting I was compelled to think B&W. Interestingly, looking back through my portfolio recently, I haven't produced much mono in yonks. I'm not sure why that is, as it certainly isn't deliberate, so, I guess my visual awareness is drawn more towards colour, even though I know I resist too many colours in a single image. However, the harsh contrast light and in particular blue skies made me automatically think mono on this weekend. So barring a few early morning (softer light) frames most of the weekend was geared towards B&W and stark contrast.COLOUR LANDSCAPESView fullsizeRoad between Blythburgh and SouthwoldView fullsizeiPhone grab shot of reed beds at sunriseThe early, pre-sunrise, opportunities were my favourite, not so much because of the intense colour you record in defused light but because of the atmospheric situation of being, mainly alone, just you, your camera and the empty space and tranquillity of no one else around. We were based in Blythburgh, a ten-minute drive to Southwold or Walberswick, which gave us a few options for sunrise shots. Southwold Pier, beach huts and even the country road into the town provides plenty of opportunities for the \"classic\" shots of the pier etc or for the more \"rebellious\" individuals some gorgeous fields, woodlands and reed beds.View fullsizePre-Sunrise Southwold pierView fullsizeSunrise Southwold Pier----------------------------------------MONO LANDSCAPESOne of the biggest challenges of landscape/outdoor photography is adapting to the available light and conditions. It's somewhat easy to apply mechanical thinking to camera settings to work around the light, Bracketing/HDR, filters and whatever other tricks you can apply to capture a dynamic range of light in excess of the sensor's native capability. So faced with bright b the available light and conditions. It's somewhat easy to apply mechanical thinking to camera settings to work around the light, Bracketing/HDR, filters and whatever other tricks you can apply to capture a dynamic range of light in excess of the sensor's native capability. So faced with bright blue skies for three days of harsh light and barely any colour revealing itself after 10 am there was the only way to go was think mono.> \"Do not take the drastic step of abolishing or discarding something in its entirety when only part of it is unacceptable\"Mono, for me at least, has always been about removing colour because it's a distraction rather than something \"arty to do\". I rarely dabble in flicking any image to mono just because it's easy to do in post-production, instead, I have been fairly steadfast in the approach of thinking mono at the time of framing and capture. Thus the last weekend in Suffolk was largely an exercise in working in a monotone mindset throughout the day.Looking for high contrast situations, shapes/patterns and textural differences that I could compose together to form something that was evocative.View fullsizeSouthwold Pier Sunrise MonoView fullsizeSouthwold Pier & defenses sunriseMOODY MONOOnce it got past 10 am the mood of light changed considerably and the tonal range of light became extreme. Using spot metering to expose for the brightest elements and tone down everything else in relation to the bright part, created some very moody and contrasty exposures. This technique became the method to search for those subjects and scenes that exploited this relationship in the light.View fullsizeDunwich GrassesView fullsizeShingle Street LayersView fullsizeHerringfleet MillView fullsizeFelixstowe DefensesView fullsizeWalberswick Sand DunesView fullsizeShingle Street PoolsView fullsizeHerringfleet Reed BedsView fullsizeTown and Country----------------------------------------It was an interesting weekend and reminded me of my own roots and the potential of this unexplored landscape, and my own approach to dealing with difficult light. I am pleased that is has forced me to take on mono again. I don't think for one minute, that I have mastered the execution but it feels good to be outside of a comfort zone again.I'm looking forward to going back there again in September on another workshop to explore and develop this untapped area.

It may take some time for them to scan and match infringements and generally they are only interested in a legal case on your behalf if the infringement for commercial or business use. If they find commercial infringement they will take the case on your behalf and deduct a service fee from any royalty/usage fee they receive from the offender.----------------------------------------/s/copyright-notice-digital-images-photographs-and-the-internet.pdfnews , photography-tips A educt a service fee from any royalty/usage fee they receive from the offender.----------------------------------------/s/copyright-notice-digital-images-photographs-and-the-internet.pdfnews , photography-tips Alan Ranger 28 January 2018Alan Ranger Photography news , copyright LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "HELP PORTRAIT - COVENTRY REPORT | GIVING PICTURES NOT TAKINGBACKGROUNDJUST OVER A YEAR AGO, WHILST THINKING ABOUT NEW YEAR RESOLUTIONS AND THINGS I WANTED TO DO IN 2017, I CAME ACROSS THE HELP PORTRAIT MOVEMENT. Help Portrait is a global movement of photographers, hairstylists and makeup artists using their time, tools and expertise to give back to those in need.Help Portrait is about GIVING the pictures, not taking them. These portraits aren’t for a portfolio, website, or sale. It’s about giving people who otherwise couldn’t afford photography, a chance to capture a moment, a memory…and a whole lot more.Photography has always been something that is an expression of individual perspective, values and interpretation for me. Images that don't convey a narrative or have a reason for personal connection simply don't resonate or hold my attention. I wanted to connect what I do for a living, in the community I live in with people I encounter and feel compassion for. The idea was simple if I cannot go and photograph refugees or victims of famine, war and other injustices then I should at least start at home and use my skills to raise awareness, inform and give photography back to those who could not afford it. In the process, I aimed to give people, volunteers and recipients, some dignity, respect and sense of how a photograph can make a difference on many levels.I proposed the idea to my Facebook Client Group (Alan Ranger Photography) and was delighted that aphy back to those who could not afford it. In the process, I aimed to give people, volunteers and recipients, some dignity, respect and sense of how a photograph can make a difference on many levels.I proposed the idea to my Facebook Client Group (Alan Ranger Photography) and was delighted that there were a number of people who wanted to support the idea.What followed over the next six-nine months were many meetings and sometimes resistance to my insistence to plan methodically and set the bar high on execution. I'm pleased to say that despite my initial fears about who, how, when, why were largely academic. However, I am also confident in saying that the team, collectively, through my nagging and pushing did rise to the challenges I set and have produced the most wonderful outcome for the people we aimed to reach and support.https://xposure.ae/XpsoureThrough my association with Xposure International Photography Festival, we managed to secure sponsorship that meant equipment and consumables were financed. Their support financially and ethically is so appreciated and we cannot thank them enough for everything they have provided that has ensured that a great idea didn't get beached due to financial resources to provide what we needed.----------------------------------------WHO TO SUPPORT?After the initial idea was hatched about photographers and others providing their skills, expertise and time to provide people in need with a special day, we had the task of identifying a group of people.Having previously worked with Crisis Skylight in Coventry on Christmas Day to provide homeless people a special day, it occurred to me that whilst my time on the day was helpful, my skills and experience were not really utilised by serving cups of squash and dinners. Don't get me wrong, I was and am happy to do whatever is needed to provide vulnerable people with what is needed. However, I felt that more could be done and I could be put to even better use.So Crisis Skylight in Coventry became our target group of people to provide a professional portrait print and whatever other services we could combine to make it a special day.CRISIS SKYLIGHT COVENTRYCrisisCrisis Skylight Coventry and Warwickshire is an outreach service that works with homeless individuals and those at risk of homelessness.Based in the city centre, they deliver their services throughout Coventry in various venues including those provided by partners. Crisis Skylight come into contact with over 600 people a year in Coventry.Homelessness in all its guises is sad. Not everyone is a rough sleeper and many people find themselves with no fixed abode for many reasons:INDIVIDUAL REASONS: * Leaving an institution * Relationship breakdown * Substance misuse * Physical or mental health problems * Escaping a violent/abusive relationshipSTRUCTURAL REASONS: * Welfare reform and benefit cuts * A low pay weakened job market * Reduced access to affordable housing marketPHOTOGRAPHS - DOCUMENT, INFORM, EDUCATE AND EXPRESSIt makes me really sad that anyone in this century ends up with such insecurity, judgement and resulting low self-esteem due to circumstances, government policy and the lack of support.My view may be simplistic, we are born equal as human beings and deserve to be given opportunities and most importantly self-respect whatever our personal circumstances and upbringing, but clearly today's society has become polarised between circumstances, government policy and the lack of support.My view may be simplistic, we are born equal as human beings and deserve to be given opportunities and most importantly self-respect whatever our personal circumstances and upbringing, but clearly today's society has become polarised between the haves and have-nots.Help PortraitBe it mental health, relationship issues/consequences, education, welfare state cuts and access to the support that each individual needs to make a better life, we all live in the same community, share the same streets, shops and services but most importantly all want an improved standard of living and life. I feel that it benefits society as a whole if everyone in it feels they are part of it and is contributing in any way they can and gets the support they need to progress themselves and their communities further.My thoughts were idealistic maybe but also heartfelt and I know those that supported the event shared the same feelings of outrage, compassion and wanting to do something that gave vulnerable people who had fallen on bad times some hope dignity and self-worth again through the power of a photograph.Quote from Crisis Team on the eventHELP-PORTRAIT WAS ONE OF OUR HIGHEST ATTENDED ACTIVITIES IN THE 4 AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN COVENTRY & WARWICKSHIRE. WE MANAGED TO ENGAGE THE MOST ENTRENCHED AND HARD TO REACH HOMELESS PEOPLE IN THE REGION AND OUR TEAM WERE AMAZED AND OVERJOYED AT THE TURNOUT.----------------------------------------For further support:Rehab Recovery - a free helpline and advisory service for people experiencing issues with substance misuse.Telephone: 0800 088 6686----------------------------------------THE EVENTSaturday 2nd December - Help-Portrait, organised by Alan Ranger Photography, sponsored by Xposure and partnered by Crisis Skylight and The Salvation Army.The Stats: * 30 Volunteers - made up of 10 Photographers, 3 Hair Stylists, 2 Make-up Artists, and 15 friends/supporters gave their time and skills to provide. * 35 homeless people had haircuts/hair styling * 23 homeless people had make-overs and makeup * 58 homeless people with a professional portrait print and a digital version for download * Homeless gender mix 22 Women (38%), 36 (62%) Men from the Coventry and Warwickshire area * £945 raised (to date) for CrisisServices provided on the day: * Sandwiches, soup, drinks and cakes * Hairstyling and makeover * Professional portrait print + digital download * Clothes and gifts to take away (donated by team and public) * Crisis registration/contact for further support * A venue (Salvation Army) to host the event and provide homeless people a day to remember. * A friendly reception, compassionate attitude and respect to their situation and needs.FEEDBACK FROM CRISIS> The care, attention and dignity that Alan and his team of volunteers showed the guests was truly inspiring and the transformation and boost in their confidence is something we will never forget.> The atmosphere throughout the day was electric and our members were so proud of their portraits that they can now go on to give as gifts, help them to find work or just keep with them as a memory of such a wonderful day.> The feedback from the guests has demonstrated an increase in confidence, trust and relationships with others.

      "articleBody": "HELP PORTRAIT - UK-COVENTRY-SCHOOL-SHOOT | GIVING PICTURESI'm really pleased to report on our first Help-Portrait shoot in Coventry. Last night, 4th July 2017, my crew gave up their time, expertise and equipment to shoot 25 family portraits in a local school.Help Portrait is a global movement of photographers, hairstylists and makeup artists using their time, tools and expertise to give back to those in need.Help-Portrait is about GIVING the pictures, not taking them. These portraits aren’t for a portfolio, website, or sale. It’s about giving people who otherwise couldn’t afford photography, a chance to capture a moment, a memory…and a whole lot more. Read more about Help-Portrait-UK-Coventry here: Although the International Help-Portrait day isn't until 2nd Dec 2017, my team was keen to hold an event before that date to test, hone their skills and most importantly use everyone's expertise to hold the first event for the school that is in a disadvantaged area of Coventry. ----------------------------------------View fullsize----------------------------------------The team, Joyce James, Chris Shaw, Kirsten Pearce, Nicholas Jones and Ellen Shaw came together to shoot 25 family portraits, edit, print and mount the images in a 2hr window so that the families could take their photo's home the same night after their sports award presentation evening event.BEHIND THE SCENESView fullsize2 identical s Pearce, Nicholas Jones and Ellen Shaw came together to shoot 25 family portraits, edit, print and mount the images in a 2hr window so that the families could take their photo's home the same night after their sports award presentation evening event.BEHIND THE SCENESView fullsize2 identical shooting rigsView fullsizeFamily viewing their photo before printingView fullsizeNick and Kirsten - SharpshootersView fullsizeTethered workstationsView fullsizeNick in actionView fullsizethe shooters eagerly waiting for a family----------------------------------------I can't honestly say that everything worked like clockwork but despite the odd technical glitch and challenge of framing large groups against a small backdrop, we managed to pull it off and made a professional portrait print from start to finish in 10mins for each family.Most importantly, of course, was the pleasure we all got from seeing the smiling faces of the families as they collected their printed photos.----------------------------------------FAMILIES COLLECTING THEIR PRINTSView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------SELECTION OF PORTRAITS TAKEN ON THE NIGHTView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------THANK YOUI'd like to thank Jeanette, the Head Teacher, for allowing us to run the event at the school and for supporting us with her staff on the night, they all helped to make the night a great success.A special thank you to Simon Newton and the Xposure Photography Festival team in Sharjah for sponsoring us and contributing towards the kit. Your support is really appreciated by all those involved with the project and receiving the prints.Finally but of course not least, my shooting crew who all performed wonderfully to bring everything together for the event.If you would like to get involved in the Help-Portrait movement then please make contact with me.

      "articleBody": "NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHY - SHOOTING IN LOW LIGHT TIPSNIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHYIt’s amazing how much the landscape can change during the dark hours of the night. During winter, we have even more opportunities to explore its depths.A bright, colourful meadow can turn into a dim and mysterious void of nothingness when night descends upon it. Even if the environment around you is consumed by the night, photography still has its place and can even produce more mesmerising photos than during the day.View fullsizePREPARATION IS KEYWith any form of photography, I’d always urge you to do thorough preparation before going out into the field, especially with night photography. The last thing you want to do is fumble around in the darkness trying to set your camera up right or find the best spot. Even if you remember to bring a torch, this inconvenience can be avoided with the right preparation.You also might want to scope out the area before hand and decide exactly what you want to photograph. You don’t want daybreak to come along and bring the light that might ruin your perfect shot.View fullsizeDusk at Kenilworth CastleShooting near a city? Light trails are perfect for night shoots, giving us a glimpse into the hidden pathways light travels every day. Remember though, light pollution can greatly affect your photos, presenting unwanted illumination so pick your spot carefully.View fullsizeCity Centre at nightREMEMBER YOUR CAMERA SETTINGS - NIGHT TIME PH r night shoots, giving us a glimpse into the hidden pathways light travels every day. Remember though, light pollution can greatly affect your photos, presenting unwanted illumination so pick your spot carefully.View fullsizeCity Centre at nightREMEMBER YOUR CAMERA SETTINGS - NIGHT TIME PHOTOGRAPHYIf you’re used to always shooting in brightly lit areas, you’ll probably be used to using similar if not the same camera settings during your shoots. However with night time photography, you’re in a whole other world that requires a very different camera set up.Unless you’re shooting at close range, using the flash on your camera isn’t recommended. Utilising a long exposure is more useful, allowing more captivating details and hidden oddities to be captured in a single photograph. This method is highly useful whilst focussing on the night sky, capturing the stars that have bewildered mankind for centuries.To make the most of the time you have under the stars, you need to invest in a tripod to keep your camera as still as possible, removing any risk of blurred photos. Even using a remote release will greatly aid your aim to get the clearest image.With so much potential, it would be a shame to not make the most of photography during the night.AS ALWAYS, BE CREATIVE WITH IT!With any and all photography it’s important to experiment with new things and see what works best in the scenarios you find yourself in. Experiment with shutter speeds, aperture, angles; the night has so much to offer whether it be in nature or the confines of the city.View fullsizeChesterton Windmill at nightSo with camera in hand, explore the mysteries of the night to improve your skills in night time photography.

      "articleBody": "RUBY'S FIRST PHOTO PROJECT | THE START OF HER JOURNEYPHOTO PROJECTI am about to start teaching a photography course to a class in a special needs school and have had to prepare a range of photographic tasks and ideas that could be enjoyed and tackled by children with a range of learning abilities.Having sketched out a rough outline I thought who better to try it out with than my own kids.My daughter, Ruby 9yrs, jumped at the opportunity to demonstrate, or as she put it - prove, that she was as good as her Dad. Nothing like a bit of family competition to get the kids to do something you want them to do! She even did a twist on my logo to create her own version for herself.It didn't take long to explain to her that she had to take six shots and then put them together in a hand-made photo album with a short statement to write for each photo. Ruby did the whole project in one weekend and put her heart and soul into every shot. Whilst I naturally helped her with camera settings for each shot she decided her own subject matter, took all the shots and then picked her favourite ones for the album.I know I am bound to be a little bias, aren't all Dads? However what really impressed me was that she had the patience to keep trying to get exactly what she wanted. She knew, without prompting the importance of it being in focus and sharp and even more impressive was that she understood that you shouldn't have any distractions in the photo so moved her own position a ally impressed me was that she had the patience to keep trying to get exactly what she wanted. She knew, without prompting the importance of it being in focus and sharp and even more impressive was that she understood that you shouldn't have any distractions in the photo so moved her own position and used the lens to zoom in and out to get the composition she wanted.So here's my girls first photo project - she is very proud of it and I am very proud of her and hope this is the start of something we can continue to enjoy together for many years to come.So I'd encourage all you parents, grandparents, Aunties and Uncles to get children involved with photography beyond smartphone selfies, you might even learn a thing or two from them about photography and they will certainly show you a perspective and interpretation that isn't obvious to you.RUBY'S PHOTOS AND HER OWN WRITE UP FOR EACH IMAGE UNDER THE PHOTO----------------------------------------View fullsizeFront CoverView fullsizeIndexView fullsizeInside CoverView fullsizePHOTO PROJECT - PORTRAITView fullsizeTitle of Image:Red Ruby DayDescription:The portrait shot has to be a mirror image or a selfie.How did you take the shot?How I did it, I held the camera at an angle and tried to fit in all of my face. We held the button down so it took lots of pictures. The camera put 16 pictures in to 1 photo. It was quite easy thinking about it.When you look at the photo what do you think? I think it’s so cool even though I knew that anyway. If you were me you would know. When I first looked at myself I thought that I was being a bit silly. I pulled a face like I was doing a selfie, I was trying to be silly as it was red nose day.How hard was it to take the shot?It can be tricky some times because you have to be extremely still and focused on the mirror.PHOTO PROJECT - ACTIONView fullsizeTitle of Image:Bubble dayDescription:A live photo and a movement + action shotHow did you take the shot?We had to make sure it shot fast we pressed the button half way to focus then we held the button all the way down once he started blowing bubbles.When you look at the photo what do you think?It says pop and its breath taking because you use your breath to blow bubbles but you can’t see your breath, only the bubbles so that’s the good thing.How hard was it to take the shot?It was quite hard because he only blew one bubble, so we were doing it a long time to complete this task.PHOTO PROJECT - STILL LIFEView fullsizeView fullsizeTitle of Image:Coffee RescueMinion’s Banana RaidDescription:She fell in the cup making coffee her friend helps her.Minions are carrying banana to their blood – thirsty bedrooms and are going to make a hammock for a bed.How did you take the shot?We placed them in positions then I had to be very still and I took a photo of them.When you look at the photo what do you think?I think that if I were in a mug I would want help and I would be hurt.I would love to make my own hammock of banana skins.How hard was it to take the shot?I had to hold the camera very still and I had to try very hard not to show the background of the table in the pictures.PHOTO PROJECT - ABSTRACTView fullsizeView fullsizeTitle of Image:Wood of AnubisThe increased patternDescription:Growling at the wood chopper to go away.Stripy patterns.How did you take the shot?Be low down and only the pattern was show the background of the table in the pictures.PHOTO PROJECT - ABSTRACTView fullsizeView fullsizeTitle of Image:Wood of AnubisThe increased patternDescription:Growling at the wood chopper to go away.Stripy patterns.How did you take the shot?Be low down and only the pattern was in the shot.When you look at the photo what do you think?With its nasty eyes, I think its evil.All the patterns and spots make me think of leopards and there razor–sharp teeth!How hard was it to take the shot?No because I only had to squat down and be steady and still.PHOTO PROJECT - NATUREView fullsizeTitle of Image:BlossomDescription:Sun catching her tentacles.How did you take the shot?I waited and waited till the light was on the flower and then when the flower was still I quickly shot a picture.When you look at the photo what do you think?I think of Dads garden because it is in his garden.How hard was it to take the shot?Yes hard because I had to wait for the sun to gleam and the wind to stop blowing the flower.PHOTO PROJECT - TWISTED SHOTView fullsizeTitle of Image:Gulliver’s GravelDescription:My Brother is upside down and looks like his has a face upside down.How did you take the shot?My brother sat on the swing and then leant backwards until he was upside down. Then I took the photo with him looking upwards.When you look at the photo what do you think?I think of a hairy cheek manHow hard was it to take the shot?It was easy because I just had to photograph him upside down.news Alan Ranger 30 March 2017Alan Ranger Photography kids LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "MY LRPS JOURNEY – MIKE FORD | CLIENT RPS DISTINCTIONSMY RPS DISTINCTIONS JOURNEY MIKE FORD – MIKE FORD LRPSI am pleased to be able to share a guest blog from Mike who achieved his LRPS Distinction in September 2015. A big congratulations to Mike on this significant milestone and next step on his photographic journey. The RPS - Royal Photographic Society, has three levels of RPS distinctions that they award to successful applicants. Mike was awarded the Licentiateship Distinction enabling him to use the LRPS letters after his name and more importantly proving that he has reached a competent level of camera skill and composition in image making.> LRPS (Licentiateship of The RPS) - images of a high standard of photographic execution - demanding but achievable for most dedicated photographers. Applicants must show variety in approach and techniques but not necessarily in subject matter.If you are interested in applying for a RPS Distinctions more information can be found on the RPS website here: https://www.rps.org/distinctions I am already supporting and coaching a number of people towards their distinctions with the RPS so am more than happy to offer the same support to you, just get in touch with me.----------------------------------------GUEST BLOG BY MIKE FORD - RPS DISTINCTIONSI've gained so much on my LRPS journey, but my biggest improvement has been learning what to do to improve my shots, either in Lightroom or in camera.Having been intereste ort to you, just get in touch with me.----------------------------------------GUEST BLOG BY MIKE FORD - RPS DISTINCTIONSI've gained so much on my LRPS journey, but my biggest improvement has been learning what to do to improve my shots, either in Lightroom or in camera.Having been interested in photography for over 30 years, when I moved house 10 years ago, I thought how nice it would be if all the pictures that I hung in the house were of my own shots.FIRST STEPS - RPS DISTINCTIONSMy story really begins there. I’d become aware of the RPS distinctions advisory days, where you get your portfolio critiqued. You have to present 10 pictures in a panel; mine was in 2 rows of 5 pictures per row. I sorted and printed my 10 best images in full glossy colour on my normal printer. The pictures have to be mounted - another new experience!What a day! Watching everyone else’s panels being critiqued was a lesson in itself. It was amazing to watch how a panel could be made more aesthetically pleasing and balanced simply by changing the position of the pictures.I’d never heard of blown highlights even though I had some good examples in my portfolio! The assessor explained, “There is no detail there, there’s nothing but the printer paper”. The smallest imperfections were spotted. The panel images needed to be technically perfect! I had a lot to learn.Only 3 of my 10 shots were good enough to survive that first mauling. The comment on the Dangerous Waves picture was the highlight of the day, “I wish I had taken that one”. While I still had lots to learn and do I was enthused and had learnt an enormous amount in that one day.Dangerous WavesMy new challenge became not just taking a good picture but also how to process the image for printing. I noticed that whatever I did my images never looked as sharp or with the same clarity you see in magazines. I knew I was missing something but didn't know what.THE RIGHT HELPI met Alan Ranger at the Photography Show at the NEC in March 2014.He understood straight away what I was looking for and I liked his style. I booked 2 half day sessions and used one of those to learn Lightroom. I learnt more in that half day session than in the last six months of playing with the sliders. Suddenly my processed images looked different, much more alive and fresh than ever before. Coupled with a better printer and good quality paper I could start to see the difference in my printed work. I joined Alan’s monthly mentoring program which has been real hard work but well worth the effort. I’m now in my second year of it.Alan’s feedback on my monthly submissions has been instrumental at making me take a harder look at my images. The feedback is excellent, sometimes brutally honest but very targeted at what you need to do to improve. It can be hard to take sometimes but when you stop and think about the feedback you realise it makes sense. The mentoring programme under Alan’s tuition has been the biggest contributor to improving my images; from showing me how to process the image correctly, pulling the detail out of the shadows and generally really getting to grips with how to use Lightroom to get the best out of my images.I was really focused on getting good images for my portfolio., The challenge is that as the portfolio develops the images needed to fill the gaps become more defined. Just one more good image isn’t always good enough as it has to balance in the panel in terms of subject, co best out of my images.I was really focused on getting good images for my portfolio., The challenge is that as the portfolio develops the images needed to fill the gaps become more defined. Just one more good image isn’t always good enough as it has to balance in the panel in terms of subject, colour etc. From the feedback on the mentoring program I learned how to better critique my own pictures and some of my personal favourites were rejected due to slight imperfections. I had become much more critical and my attention to detail had changed significantly.My panel was now fastened to the wall in my study so I could see it develop and it was a constant reminder of what images I needed to take to finish it off. From that initial advisory day only two of my original panel survived all the way through to the final submission - Girl Street Portrait and Dangerous Waves.MY FINAL RPS DISTINCTIONS PANELSo let me talk about my final panel, it consists of two rows of 5 images. You can see the symmetry in the panel with 4 mono images in portrait format in the 4 corners. All these four had to be processed so that they all had the same tonal range so they looked consistent and to show that I know how to process mono images.The girl on the top left is looking into the panel and the guys on the top right are generally looking inwards to the panel. This looks more balanced than if they had been facing the other way and looking out of the panel. The wooden pier also bends into the panel rather than out of it.View fullsizeMike Ford - Final L PanelThe two striking images are the Dangerous Waves and the Playing Cards, these are in a central position as it would have been difficult to find another image to balance them out if they had been in any other place in the panel. On the top row the Playing Cards image is flanked by two wildlife images, both looking into the panel.On the bottom row the Dangerous Waves in flanked by 2 landscape images to balance and compliment the top row. The two central images complement each other as they both show movement.To prepare for the big day I reviewed all the images again and ensured they were all processed correctly, sometimes going over the same image time and time again until it looked right. I ensured there were no dust spots, blown highlights, dark shadows etc. before printing them all again onto the same paper type so they looked consistent. They were then mounted on off white mounts ready for showing. JUDGEMENT DAYOn the day itself there were 5 judges, and in a dimmed room the pictures are illuminated and are reviewed from about 2 metres away, they then get up and study the images very closely. They take images down and scrutinise them in great detail.There are 5 characteristics that they are looking for and then each judge scores the panel independently before passing the score sheets to the chairperson to tally the scores. The panel has to pass all 5 characteristics to be successful. The five characteristics are Presentation, Technical Camera, Technical Technique, Visual Technique and Communication.Once the scores have been tallied up the Chairperson gets up and announces the result. The Chairperson then asked one of the judges to talk for 5 minutes about my panel. He commented about the amount of photographer input into several of the images showing that I had made a conscious decision on how to influence the final image.THE FUTUREJoining a mentoring programme like Alan’s The Chairperson then asked one of the judges to talk for 5 minutes about my panel. He commented about the amount of photographer input into several of the images showing that I had made a conscious decision on how to influence the final image.THE FUTUREJoining a mentoring programme like Alan’s is a great way to get the very best out of your images, to challenge you, and to show you how to improve. My time with Alan has helped me to look at my images with a fresh pair of eyes and be much more objective in my approach and due to Alan’s feedback my attention to detail has risen dramatically.So what’s next? I’ll be continuing to improve using Alan’s mentoring program, moving up to the personalised programme. I've already started to think about going to the next level of ARPS where you need 15 pictures but this time linked together in a theme. I am extremely pleased with my achievement to date, but I also realise that I can still develop and improve… .

I guess some might say that's a little 'nit-picky', but to the trained eye, a slanted horizon is very obvious and distracting.built in level for 2 axisIt also shows that the photographer has either not noticed it, doesn't know how to correct it or just doesn't think it looks as bad as I do! In any case it's such an easy thing to fix. Naturally, as you know I advocate getting it right in camera at the time of making the image. If you don't and therefore need to straighten in software you run the risk of having to crop some vital edges out of your image.There really is no excuse these days for wonky horizon's - many DSLR's and bridge camera's have a built in spirit level tool to show you when making the image if its it straight or not. They typically allow you to adjust your level on 2 axis, horizontal and tilt and aids camera levelingEven if you don't have this feature on your camera you can buy an accessory instead.NEVER TAKE A WONKY SHOT AGAIN WITH THIS HANDY, POCKET SIZED TOOL!This DSLR Camera spirit level is the perfect solution for the photographer that loves to travel light, without missing that once in a lifetime shot.£1.50 from Amazon The spirit level: camera leveling * Is sim ITH THIS HANDY, POCKET SIZED TOOL!This DSLR Camera spirit level is the perfect solution for the photographer that loves to travel light, without missing that once in a lifetime shot.£1.50 from Amazon The spirit level: camera leveling * Is simple and quick to attach to the camera - Just mount it on your flash hot shoe! * Ensuring your camera is level is a massive priority, especially when using a tripod on uneven ground or for a panoramic. * One size fits all – This spirit level fits almost all DSLR/SLR cameras with a standard flast hot shoe fitting.This small tool is great value for money when your pictures are concerned. ----------------------------------------If you don't have either and don't want to spend £1.50 on this accessory then at least take 5 secs to check and correct any obvious wonky horizons in your images - it really does make a difference.photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 31 January 2016recommended-products , NIK LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

Not all camera's allow you to review the image you have taken through the viewfinder - assuming your camera even has a viewfinder!LCD VIEWFINDER - CAMERA SCREENThere are a couple of alternative devices to solve this problem. They both basically do the same thing./photography-equipmentMATIN M-6296 2X LCD VIEWFINDER KIT TO FIT 3.2 INCH SCREEN/photography-equipmentAvailable from my recommended products through Amazon Associates Store at £38.This device will cover a LCD screen up to 3.2\" which covers pretty much most camera types.It also allows for 2 x magnification so helps you see those details and check sharpness/focus and depth of field even more accurately.-5 to +3 diopter adjustment for those who wear glasses.It comes supplied with a pouch and neck strap.HOODMAN HOODLOUPE/photography-equipmentAvailable from my recommended products through Amazon Associates Store at £87.Works exactly the same as the Matin above - so why the extra £50?I don't know the answer to that other than it uses minimal magnification to prevent eliminate visual pixilation of your image and comes with with ¼ 20 mounting solution thread----------------------------------------Anyone who has attended one of my workshops Matin above - so why the extra £50?I don't know the answer to that other than it uses minimal magnification to prevent eliminate visual pixilation of your image and comes with with ¼ 20 mounting solution thread----------------------------------------Anyone who has attended one of my workshops will tell you how I bang the drum repeatedly about reviewing your image on the camera screen to check for all those silly mistakes, imperfections and opportunities to re-take and improve the shot both technically and creatively. These devices can really make the difference of that process being achievable or not so if you care about getting it right don't go on a shoot without one.My Amazon Associates Store contains many products I recommend and personally use - click on this store link to see what you can add to your kit bag to make like easier and your photography easier to do.photography-tips , recommended-products Alan Ranger 31 January 2016recommended-products , NIK LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT FOR BEGINNERS | PROFESSIONAL GUIDEPHOTOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT FOR BEGINNERSIf you’re only just entering the world of photography, understanding what equipment is essential, useful or simply just an accessory. At first, every piece of equipment seems vital to producing the high quality shots you aspire to create. Still, every photographer should start with the basics.Here are my tips and guidelines to help you understand photography equipment.A camera, lens and a creative imaginationThese are the only 3 things you need to start your photography journey. This is the starting point of most professional photographers; a humble beginning that led to their specially honed skills.View fullsizeLandscape PhotographylensBut how do you know what camera to choose? With so many various types available, it can be difficult deciding which will best serve your needs. I have many tips for choosing a camera but for a beginner a simple, amateur camera should help you get started. I would always recommend one of these entry level cameras if you’re serious about making photography your new hobby. As for lenses, sticking to the lens that comes with your first camera is always a safe bet. When you become more knowledgeable and experienced in photography, then you can go out and experiment with the variety of lenses available to you. Practicing and seeing out making photography your new hobby. As for lenses, sticking to the lens that comes with your first camera is always a safe bet. When you become more knowledgeable and experienced in photography, then you can go out and experiment with the variety of lenses available to you. Practicing and seeing how your camera operates is the best thing you can do when you first start out.I would argue however that the most important tools you need for photography are creativity and enthusiasm. Creativity can be developed as you experiment with different angles, light and subjects; enthusiasm is more difficult. Just focus on what interests you and you’ll be going in the right direction.My favourite form of photography is landscape; diverse, always changing and always sparking curiosity in my mind. Finding your niche can only be found through experimentation so don’t be afraid to try all aspects of photography until you find a genre you love!Pick the right equipment for youOnce you’ve got a feel for how your camera works, you can experiment with the plethora of equipment available to photographers. All of these pieces of equipment aim to improve your all-important shots but do take care when picking the right equipment for your requirements.For first time photographers, keeping the camera steady can be a challenge. If you have an unsteady hand I would highly recommend investing in a tripod and remote release.Remote releases remove the risk of movement whilst shooting and have the exact same features as the button already on your camera. These are great for shots which require longer exposure. When combined with a tripod, you won’t need to strain your hands as you attempt to hold the camera in a steady position. By purchasing a remote release you can greatly reduce camera shake and improve the quality of your images.Like remote releases, tripods greatly reduce blurred and off focus images. One handy use of tripods is that you can potentially reach angles and positions you couldn’t with your hands alone. Whether your shot is higher than your usual reach or uncomfortably low to the ground, most tripods can be adjusted to any height and can be placed in any position. Purchasing a tripod is definitely one of my tools of choice when going out into the field.tripodThere’s more than physical equipment you can utilise. Editing software can also be useful in giving your images that extra um-mph needed to draw the attention of others. I’d always urge people to check over every detail in a shot whilst shooting, rather than editing it on software. However I’ve found that Adobe Lightroom can greatly enhance the colours and smaller details of a shot.This piece of software can be complicated at first glance but I find joy in offering Adobe Lightroom tuition to help aspiring photographers perfect their images.----------------------------------------Keep experimenting and keep growingOnce you start compiling your equipment together, you will eventually have your very own kit bag that will accompany you on all your photography endeavours. As you grow from your very first camera, your kit bag will grow with you.Get your kit bag ready for your photography journey and even join me in a beginner’s course where I’ll show you the wonders of photography.

      "articleBody": "PHONE CAMERA VS THE DIGITAL CAMERA | IS THE MOBILE GOOD?I have lost count of the amount of times I have heard someone say, within earshot, the iPhone has a great camera! I don't actually disagree - in fact in my view it does have a great camera but in what context? If you are measuring the iPhone's camera capability against other smartphones then you would probably be hard pushed to find a lot better. However, as any owner of a digital bridge or DSLR camera knows, the smartphone camera's just don't pack the punch when it comes to viewing your photo on a screen size larger than 5x3 inches.The smartphone camera does have one huge advantage over all other camera's - it's generally always on you! As I found out earlier this week, on a short break in Devon with my 7yr old daughter, you can't always have your favored gear with you - especially when you are in the company of family who are not so patient when it comes to creating photographs.Sometimes you just have to use what you have, however imperfect that maybe, and however much you know it won't be as good as what you could create with your preferred set-up.So here are a few shots taken with the iPhone 5, whilst away. The first shot is straight from the iPhone - unedited and the following shot is with some tonal adjustments in Lightroom to try and give the grainy images a little pop.original from iPhone 5original from iPhone 5edited version in Lightroomedited version in LightroomNotice the grain and y.

With advancements in smartphone technology, many are questioning whether they still need a traditional digital camera. This article provides an in-depth comparison to help you make an informed decision.UNDERSTANDING THE BASICSPHONE CAMERASModern smartphones are equipped with powerful cameras that offer convenience and impressive features. They are lightweight, portable, and always at hand, making them ideal for spontaneous photography.DIGITAL CAMERASDigital cameras, including DSLRs and mirrorless models, are renowned for their superior image quality and versatile lenses. They are the go-to choice for professional photographers and enthusiasts who prioritize depth and detail.KEY COMPARISONSIMAGE QUALITY * Phone Cameras: While they offer high resolution and automatic settings, they often struggle in low-light conditions and with depth of field. * Digital Cameras: Provide larger sensors and interchangeable lenses, resulting in better performance in varied lighting and more creative control.PORTABILITY AND CONVENIENCE * Phone Cameras: Easily fit in your pocket and are perfect for travel and casual photography. * Digital Cameras: Bulkier, but worth the weight if you're seeking top-notch quality and flexibility.FEATURES AND FLEXIBILITY * Phone Cameras: Include features like portrait mode and automatic HDR, but limited manual controls. * Digital Cameras: Offer extensive manual controls, optical zoom, and a range of shooting modes.USE-CASESEVERYDAY PHOTOGRAPHYFor casual photographers, phone cameras offer the perfect balance of quality and convenience.PROFESSIONAL WORKDigital cameras are unmatched when it comes to professional-grade photography, providing the necessary tools for high-quality shoots.USER ENGAGEMENTFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS * Can a phone camera replace a digital camera? * It depends on your needs. For quick snaps, phones are great. For in-depth projects, digital cameras excel. * Are digital cameras still worth it? * Yes, for those who value image quality and creative control.CONCLUSIONChoosing between a phone camera and a digital camera ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences. If convenience and portability are your priorities, a phone camera may suffice. However, for those who seek superior image quality and creative flexibility, investing in a digital camera is worthwhile.Interested in exploring more about photography?

      "articleBody": "PHOTOGRAPHY – THE EPITOME OF ART - STORIES WITHOUT WORDSPHOTOGRAPHY – THE EPITOME OF ARTAs all photographers will argue, photography is an art in its own right, enchanting millions upon millions of onlookers every year. Yet there are those that would argue otherwise, claiming that there is no skill or thought into taking a picture of a luscious landscape or chaotic city. They couldn't be more wrong…STORIES WITHOUT WORDSThe stories that can be told with photography can be just as gripping and emotive as stories in the written word. We already express the lives of people through books, songs and paintings; so why are photographs any different? Through the understated medium of photography, we have been able to produce emotive works of art that have moved the hearts of countless people for generations.Sometimes it’s impossible to describe something in words alone. Sometimes the only way to believe something is to see it for yourself. That’s what photography allows us to do. It’s a window into the lives and experiences of everything and anything on this planet. To me, that is aspect of the essence of art.View fullsizeView fullsizeIMMORTALISE SPLIT SECONDS OF LIFEOne reason why the everyday person utilises photography is to capture memories that they can look back on and reminisce over in the years to come. I believe the same can be said for anyone that holds a camera in their hands and takes a photo.No matter what the subjects are, memories are held wi EOne reason why the everyday person utilises photography is to capture memories that they can look back on and reminisce over in the years to come. I believe the same can be said for anyone that holds a camera in their hands and takes a photo.No matter what the subjects are, memories are held within that photo and stay alive in the mind of the photographer, giving that photo the same emotional weighting of any song or painting. If you’re good enough, the emotions embedded into a single photograph can spread like wildfire and ignite the hearts of countless people to share in these emotions.War photography is a prime illustration of this. We’ve all seen the photos of soldiers saying goodbye to loved ones and entire cities being brought to rubble. We’ve all felt that same sense of grief and sorrow as we imagine ourselves in that scenario, even bringing some people to tears. This is living proof that photography has the power to move the very essence of what makes us human and that again proves that photography is an art, worthy of recognition.LOSE YOURSELF IN THE ART OF PHOTOGRAPHYView fullsizeThe argument that photography is not an art is futile when considering the power a single photograph possesses. Emotions, stories and memories are all concealed in photography and waiting to be discovered by insightful and creative minds.With a world as diverse as our own, we’re spoiled for choice when choosing our photographic subjects. Whether your subject is people, animals, plants or buildings, everything on this earth has a story to be told. A story you could tell and share with the world.So why not start producing your own art by taking up a number of my photography courses and workshops , tailored to raise the next generation of photographers. These can even be brought together as a Pick ‘n’ Mix package where you could save money on your tuition.WHAT DO YOU THINK MAKES PHOTOGRAPHY AN ART?news Alan Ranger 0 Tumblr 0 Likes",

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - MIKE FORD SHARES A PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEYView fullsizeA PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY CASE STUDYMike Ford signed up for photography tuition in March 2014 after meeting me at the Photography Show at the NEC. Mike is based in Yorkshire so naturally attending classroom based evening classes was not viable. Instead Mike has had some 1-2-1 tuition, attended a location workshop and has been a committed participant on the mentoring programme for over a year now.I can't take to much credit for Mike's photography as he came to me with a reasonable understanding and good eye already. The area I think I can claim maybe a little bit of credit is in helping him to realise the full potential of his shots in Lightroom and broadening his range of topics to support his application for the Licentiateship with the RPS (Royal Photographic Society)Mike has regularly appeared in the blogs' on mentoring assignments as his work is a good and consistent standard. You will also see from his proposed panel for the RPS that he demonstrates a competent level of photography over a wide range of subjects and is now building a personal portfolio of images that show his unique perspective and connection to his subjects. Well done Mike I am very proud of your progress and know you will be successful with your photography. My only regret is that you don't live closer :)----------------------------------------View fullsizeMike's draft L Panel for the RPS - click to see large----- connection to his subjects. Well done Mike I am very proud of your progress and know you will be successful with your photography. My only regret is that you don't live closer :)----------------------------------------View fullsizeMike's draft L Panel for the RPS - click to see large----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH MIKE 1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER?a. I've always had an interest in photography for many years but recently have started to seriously look at my images and wondered why they didn’t look as the ones I used to see in the photography magazines. I wanted to understand what I needed to do differently to improve my images2. WERE YOU SCARED OR ANXIOUS TO START OUT?a. I was more excited and interested in learning new things than scared but submitting your first pictures for review is definitely a scary moment.3. WHY DID YOU SELECT ALAN AS YOUR TUTOR?a. I had decided to find a training course to learn how to get the best out of Adobe Lightroom. All the training I looked at on the internet talked about showing you what lightroom did. I really needed someone to show me how to apply it to my images. I met Alan at the Photography show and we talked about what I needed and I knew straight away his teaching style suited what I neededView fullsizeImage 1, not sure what I was thinking of, had an idea but not sure how to capture it.4. WHAT WAS YOUR MAIN MOTIVATION TO COMMIT TO ALAN’S TUITION?a. To improve the quality of my images and then to develop further to be able to get a portfolio of images together that would be good enough for joining the RPS5. WHAT TYPE OF TUITION HAVE YOU HAD FROM ALAN?a. My first course was a half day lightroom session which was excellent, I learnt so much in such a short space of time, I followed this with the mentoring assignments and another half day on a field trip.6. HOW DO YOU FEEL ALAN’S TEACHING STYLE HAS HELPED DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS THE MOST?a. My images coming out of lightroom are much better than they were in the past, I feel I have much more of an understanding of what I’m doing now with a defined workflow. Before I was just sliding the settings in a random order hoping they improved the look of the imageView fullsizeImage 2, nice scene but taken without thinking about depth of field, composition and what I was trying to capture7. WHAT ARE THE KEY THINGS ALAN HAS HELPED YOU WITH?a. Developing my photographer’s eye and attention to detail. When completing my mentoring assignments I spend much more time looking at the image I am trying to take and thinking of how it could be improved. I am more a technology person than creative so while my images are technically good they could be improved. Alan’s feedback, which is targeted at you as an individual, has pushed me to improve but he has also given tips on how to improve my creative side8. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU’VE GROWN AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?a. My images have definitely taken a step change over the last few years, I am happier with showing my images to others and I now feel I have the skills to take even better images. I feel I am much better at critiquing my own work, in the past I would have looked and been disappointed with the picture with no idea on what to do next but now I look at them knowing what I could do better to improve itView fullsizeStarting to get images that I’m pleased with - this one was from Al I am much better at critiquing my own work, in the past I would have looked and been disappointed with the picture with no idea on what to do next but now I look at them knowing what I could do better to improve itView fullsizeStarting to get images that I’m pleased with - this one was from Alan's mentoring assignment in March this year9. WHAT ARE YOUR AMBITIONS FOR THE FUTURE WITH PHOTOGRAPHY?a. To eventually have a portfolio that is good enough for entry to the RPS but also to be able to take a good images that feel proud of10. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE OTHERS WHO ARE THINKING OF STARTING PHOTOGRAPHY TUITION OR WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING?a. Start the process as soon as you can, be prepared to be challenged but you will enjoy it as you see the improvements coming11. ANY OTHER COMMENTS:a. Think about Alan’s advice and really listen and understand what he is saying, it’s quite emotive when he’s not as excited about one of your images as you are, it may have even been one of your favourites! But when you look and think about the feedback you start to see how you could improve your imagesView fullsize----------------------------------------Mike has also taken the next step with her photography by becoming an Artist to have an on-line gallery of images to sell - see her wonderful images here.Photography Tuition comes in all shapes and sizes - you may be one of those who prefers practical or theory - you may be someone who can't attend classes in the Midlands or in the evenings. You may live abroad or just have limited time or money. Whatever your constraints remember that I can provide a varied package of photography tuition to suit anyone's needs and budgets. Learning is so much easier and more fun when done with the support of a professional and the friends you will make whilst doing it.

Since then she has remained a loyal and repeat customer and has also become a friend to me. Right from the start Joyce didn't try to hide her lack of knowledge of camera operation, composition and making images the way she felt about them. In fact it would be fair to say that she has always been the first to laugh at and question her own images and methods.Joyce knows what she wants to achieve (most of the time) and even when she has not crystallised her thoughts she has always been very open to trying something new even when it doesn't necessarily appeal to her natural subject preferences.Joyce's journey has not been without some hiccups along the way in her image production, but in my view this has been one of her greatest strengths and reasons for such a dramatic progression. She doesn't take herself to seriously and we have always had a good amount of banter between us, in addition it's always been a two way street when it comes feedback and advice, which I have really appreciated.Joyce's persistence to improve is a shining example to anyone wishing to take up photography as a hobby - as I remarked to her about a year ago \"you're hooked\" and she said \"I know and I love it\" - this attitude has led Joyce to travel to many corners of the UK in pursuit of crea eally appreciated.Joyce's persistence to improve is a shining example to anyone wishing to take up photography as a hobby - as I remarked to her about a year ago \"you're hooked\" and she said \"I know and I love it\" - this attitude has led Joyce to travel to many corners of the UK in pursuit of creating images and discovering heart warming moments in those environments.Joyce is currently working on her RPS Panel for Licentiaship distinction - I am enjoying supporting this next stage of her development which followed a great set of images for the Intermediates Course and Intentions Photography Exhibition in 2014.Well done Joyce and thank you for your support, friendship and honesty.----------------------------------------INTERVIEW WITH JOYCE1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER?I've enjoyed taking photographs for many years – and initially I just wanted to improve. I guess that is still what drives me – but the desire to improve has taken on a much deeper meaning!2. WERE YOU SCARED OR ANXIOUS TO START OUT?No – ignorance is bliss! I had no idea at the outset that it would become such a big part of my life.3. WHY DID YOU SELECT ALAN AS YOUR TUTOR?I bought a Groupon voucher – on a whim.View fullsizeAn early attempt Sep 20134. WHAT WAS YOUR MAIN MOTIVATION TO COMMIT TO ALAN’S COURSE?I was hooked at the Introductory Session. I came home buzzing and couldn't wait to do the next one. I've been like that ever since!5. HOW DO YOU FEEL ALAN’S TEACHING STYLE HAS HELPED DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS THE MOST?He has a very direct and honest style and he completely respects my intelligence – he doesn't do flannel or give false praise. That suits me – he tells me quite candidly what is right or wrong with my efforts and I listen and do my best to learn.He sets high expectations and can be quite demanding – but that's like an unspoken agreement between us. I want to be as good as I can be and he wants that too. I like that he sets the bar high.I should also stress that Alan has a lively sense of humour and the sessions are good fun - we get on well. It wouldn’t work otherwise.6. WHAT ARE THE KEY THINGS ALAN HAS HELPED YOU WITH?I was a complete novice and so I needed to learn all aspects of photography – technical know how, composition, the importance of light – you name it, I'm learning about it!View fullsize7. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU’VE GROWN AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?I’d say I probably scored 1/10 in terms of ability when I started out almost 2 years ago. I'm probably at 6/10 now. I still have a lot to learn. But that's good – if it was easy it wouldn't be nearly as much fun.8. COULD YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE INTERMEDIATES PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION?The Opening Night was amazing - my family and friends turned out to support me and I felt proud, excited and somewhat emotional.The exhibition itself was the culmination of a lot of hard work – I was also delighted and relieved that I'd succeeded in getting my panel ready.9. WHAT ARE YOUR AMBITIONS FOR THE FUTURE WITH PHOTOGRAPHY?I don't know – I wouldn't like to put a ceiling on my ambition. I have no intentions of making a career out of it or anything like that – but I certainly intend to be a lot better at it than I am now.View fullsizeMy eye has developed and subject range is much broader than it used to be10. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE OTHERS WHO ARE THINKING OF STARTING PHOTOGR e no intentions of making a career out of it or anything like that – but I certainly intend to be a lot better at it than I am now.View fullsizeMy eye has developed and subject range is much broader than it used to be10. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE OTHERS WHO ARE THINKING OF STARTING PHOTOGRAPHY TUITION OR WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING?I’m not sure that I want to give advice – everyone goes into it for different reasons and with different outcomes in mind and that's good. We're all different after all. Just enjoy it I guess.View fullsizeRecent work----------------------------------------Photography Tuition comes in all shapes and sizes - you may be one of those who prefers practical or theory - you may be someone who can't attend classes in the Midlands or in the evenings.

      "articleBody": "HELP CHILDREN TAKE PHOTOS - PHOTOGRAPHY FOR KIDS GUIDEGETTING YOUR KIDS INTO PHOTOGRAPHYPHOTOGRAPHY FOR KIDSPhotography may seem like an adult’s hobby with all the seemingly complicated equipment and varied jargon that comes along with it. Yet the younger generation are just as capable and can produce beautiful pieces of art like the rest of us. When you look at the photos children capture, you are looking at the world through a completely different perspective – the eyes of an innocent child from the mind of a person that hasn't yet been influenced by as many experiences and opinions.As we get closer to spring and with Easter around the corner, the world begins to blossom with new life. What better time than now to introduce your little ones to photography?View fullsizeCamera settings explained for kidsView fullsizeKids and photographyGET DOWN TO BASICS - CHILDREN PHOTOGRAPHYYou may have reservations about handing over your beloved DSLR, that's understandable, but do you have an older camera spare, bridge camera or even a point a shoot?One thing you should avoid doing is spoiling the fun for them. Give them a few guiding tips and leave them to their own creative devices. Children are surprisingly perceptive so they should be able to pick up the basics in no time!This first tip is one that even adults can benefit from – experiment with your shots. Children are some of the most creative beings, seeing the world in a completely different way to own creative devices. Children are surprisingly perceptive so they should be able to pick up the basics in no time!This first tip is one that even adults can benefit from – experiment with your shots. Children are some of the most creative beings, seeing the world in a completely different way to that of adults. Their imaginations are always active and brimming with ideas just waiting to be put into physical form. Giving them a camera may allow you to see more than just a still image they've created.Teach them about the various angles and viewpoints they can take photographs from, instilling the idea that even the dullest of subjects can be made exciting if a little thought is put into it.Being as inquisitive as they are, children will quickly get into the swing of things, looking at subjects from every angle imaginable. Even simply explaining the importance of light in a shot is something a child can pick up on with a little help. If the child is old enough and the camera has it why not show them how to shoot in Aperture Priority Mode (A or AV) - explain that the larger the F-number (F16) the more is in focus in the shot the lower the F-number (F5.6) the less is in focus. You might be surprised how they quickly put this choice into action and start making images that go beyond looking like a snap!MAKE IT FUN! - PHOTOGRAPHY FOR KIDSKids don’t want to do something unless it’s fun and who can blame them? So making up fun little activities for them to get stuck into is a great way to help their photography skills grow.Give them a scavenger hunt or certain things to photograph for their own portfolio; a great piece of memorabilia you can reminisce on in years to come. You could even encourage their storytelling skills and get them to tell a story through a series of photographs they've taken.Giving your child something to work towards that they can be praised for is a great incentive to getting them actively involved in photography. You never know, they might even take it up as a profession one day.View fullsizeBringing a smileView fullsizeA family activityPHOTOGRAPHY FOR KIDSThe great thing about getting your child started early in their photography journey is that you can both look back on what they did as children and see how much they've developed as grow older. Let your children feel proud of their work, letting them know that as long as they’re having fun, they’re on the right track.If you want to introduce your little ones to the world of photography, I run photography mentoring on-line so their work can be done without attending evening classes or shorter (2.5hrs) photography workshops on location.These are suitable for all ages, if you enrol with your children, and see how photography can change the way you look at the world.I look forward to seeing the next generation of photographers discover the wonders of photography!photography-tips Alan Ranger 0 LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",

      "articleBody": "CASE STUDY - KIRSTEN PEARCE SHARES A PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEYOne of my early Paris pictures - Didn't know what a histogram was then and I would compose the shot differently if I took it again nowA PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY CASE STUDYKirsten Pearce first signed up photography tuition with me in June 2014. Initially she joined a 3hr introductory class and followed up with the 4 week extended beginner's course before enrolling on the on-line mentoring programme which she has been doing for a year now. Kirsten's improvement has been steady and a testament to anyone who thinks it's to difficult and gives up or believes they can just motivate themselves and doesn't need any support and advice.Whilst Kirsten has taken her first steps on her photographic journey she recognises the path ahead continues to be challenging but also exciting. Photography is a hobby for Kirsten and one she seems to take a lot of pleasure from doing. Her images have shown great steps forwards over the last 12 months and she is now much more confident in her own ability and is now developing her own individual creative perspective on the places she travels to and subjects she sees. Well done Kirsten, the initial hard work and investment is paying off, remember after just 5 weeks you had produced your first, and an excellent, audio visual as part of the 5 week beginners course. I know you will look back at some of the images in this and shudder, but it shows just how far you have come since! the initial hard work and investment is paying off, remember after just 5 weeks you had produced your first, and an excellent, audio visual as part of the 5 week beginners course. I know you will look back at some of the images in this and shudder, but it shows just how far you have come since!INTERVIEW WITH KIRSTEN1. WHY DID YOU WANT TO BECOME A PHOTOGRAPHER?Photographs were always taken during childhood holidays, a tradition that I continued once I was old enough to travel on my own. I have countless albums of photos as a record of holidays and events, both to share where I have been and as memories to keep and look back at years later.I'm not really sure where the interest in learning more about photography started. I know that moving from film to digital gave me far more scope for experimenting as if it didn't work you could delete it. I think I saw some great photographs of the buildings of Paris about 10 years ago and wanted to try to do something similar when I visited the city, looking at the buildings from different angles.Any good photographs that I took were more by luck than judgement and I realised that I would probably need to know what all of the different settings and dials on my camera were for so I could take better photographs. I experimented a bit and bought a book which gave me some clues about composition but it was a very dry way to learn and I couldn't ask questions when I was unsure.I continued to take photographs and tried to improve on my own but promised myself that one day I would learn properly. When I found Alan’s beginners course it seemed ideal. I signed up for the 3 hour introductory session and haven't looked back.2. WERE YOU SCARED OR ANXIOUS TO START OUT?Yes as I didn't know what I was letting myself in for. I was concerned that I'd be the odd one out as I had a compact camera; another reason for waiting so long before joining a course because most seemed to require a DSLR. Alan's courses are definitely accessible to all no matter what camera you are using so I didn't need to worry.3. WHY DID YOU SELECT ALAN AS YOUR TUTOR?I found one of Alan's leaflets and liked the sound of the courses that he offered; I also looked at his website to find out more and loved his photographs.I really enjoyed the introductory course and learnt more in three hours than I would ever have picked up from a book. Alan's style of teaching and way of explaining photography made everything so much clearer. The wide range of tuition available allowed me to choose a path that was suitable to my level of ability.From the Mentoring Program - abstract assignment - sep 20144. WHAT WAS YOUR MAIN MOTIVATION TO COMMIT TO ALAN’S TUITION?Having completed and thoroughly enjoyed the beginner's course I realised that despite the wealth of information and techniques that I'd learnt that there was so much more to photography than I ever would have imagined. I didn't want to stop there and felt that Alan offered a wide range of opportunities to continue my journey.5. WHAT TYPE OF TUITION HAVE YOU HAD FROM ALAN? * Beginners five week course * Monthly mentoring * Adobe Lightroom course * Evening workshop * 1-2-1 tuition6. HOW DO YOU FEEL ALAN’S TEACHING STYLE HAS HELPED DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS THE MOST?Alan is welcoming and approachable but his teaching challenges and stretches you, allowing you to progress quickly. His critiques 'take no prisoners' which was a bit disconcertin vening workshop * 1-2-1 tuition6. HOW DO YOU FEEL ALAN’S TEACHING STYLE HAS HELPED DEVELOP YOUR SKILLS THE MOST?Alan is welcoming and approachable but his teaching challenges and stretches you, allowing you to progress quickly. His critiques 'take no prisoners' which was a bit disconcerting to begin with but we were warned beforehand! I soon realised that there was no point in shying away from the truth if I was going to learn quickly.7. WHAT ARE THE KEY THINGS ALAN HAS HELPED YOU WITH?To begin with, understanding my camera fully. I only ever used automatic mode, I'm now fully aware of how to use my camera to get the result that I want and whilst I still have a long way to go it's beginning to feel more natural. After about six months I committed to getting my first DSLR camera and took 1-2-1 tuition to make sure that I was able to get the most from it which was incredibly helpful.Away from the technical side I'm finding the mentoring to be really helpful. It’s forcing me to explore genres of photography that I would otherwise not have tried. Monthly deadlines ensure that I prioritise and don't allow work commitments to get in the way. Alan's very honest feedback is really useful and I'm gradually finding myself remembering and applying his advice as I try to compose my photographs.8. HOW DO YOU THINK YOU’VE GROWN AS A PHOTOGRAPHER?I still feel like I'm at the beginning of my journey with so much more to learn but almost a year on from taking the introductory course I know that the photos that I'm taking now are very different. They are being taken with aperture or shutter priority rather than on automatic and I'm thinking carefully about composition. I have a far greater understanding of what makes a \"good photo\" and am able to look at my own photographs critically.There have been many ups and downs along the way. It has taken a while to get used to my camera and there have been good and bad months with the different mentoring themes but I'm constantly learning something new, trying different things and really enjoying my photography.From the mentoring program - 50mm assignment- feb 20159. WHAT ARE YOUR AMBITIONS FOR THE FUTURE WITH PHOTOGRAPHY?To continue to improve the quality of my photographs as much as possible and to try many different genres of photography. I will continue the mentoring and have booked Alan's fireworks workshop. I'd like to do some other workshops too and possibly work towards the intermediate course in the future.I feel more confident than I was with the technical aspects so my current goal is to work on the creative side of things. I've never seen myself as even remotely artistic so it’s my next challenge to further improve my composition, trying to convey my intention more without feeling the need to give my photographs a title when sharing them. I'm also using the skills learnt on the Adobe Lightroom course and trying to improve my post-processing. I know it will take a long time but with determination and patience I will get there and continue to improve.10. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE OTHERS WHO ARE THINKING OF STARTING PHOTOGRAPHY TUITION OR WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUDYING?There's lots of jargon to start with which took a lot of getting used to. There's lots of ups and downs too when it would be easy to give up but it does start to get easier after a while so it’s definitely worth the continued commitment to develop your skills.ANY OTHER COMMENTS:Just to say th There's lots of jargon to start with which took a lot of getting used to. There's lots of ups and downs too when it would be easy to give up but it does start to get easier after a while so it’s definitely worth the continued commitment to develop your skills.ANY OTHER COMMENTS:Just to say thank you to Alan for everything so far; for the support and feedback and for continuing to challenge me to make me a better photographer.----------------------------------------Photography Tuition comes in all shapes and sizes - you may be one of those who prefers practical or theory - you may be someone who can't attend classes in the Midlands or in the evenings. You may live abroad or just have limited time or money. Whatever your constraints remember that I can provide a varied package of photography tuition to suit anyone's needs and budgets. Learning is so much easier and more fun when done with the support of a professional and the friends you will make whilst doing it.

      "articleBody": "ABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHY - VISUAL REFERENCE | PROFESSIONAL GUIDEABSTRACT PHOTOGRAPHY IS THE ART OF SHOWING A SUBJECT INDEPENDENT OF THE VISUAL REFERENCES IN THE WORLD.Abstract images appeal more to the emotional rather than logical receptors within us. From birth and through infancy we are stimulated to respond to the visual stimulation of colour, shape and form.Abstract images have a wide interpretation through the subjective nature of the content, the use of composition to communicate the photographer’s vision is often informative and intriguing - it connects us on an emotional level in a way that other photographs don't.IT’S ANOTHER WORLD ALL TOGETHER…You only need to look at the abstract photography I’ve done in the past to see that it’s a completely different area of photography all together. Anything can be a subject in abstract photography as you can really experiment with your shots. No matter if your subject is natural or man-made, you can always enjoy discovering their textures, patterns and intricate details.You don’t even need to step outside your front door to see what it can offer you. The possibilities of abstract photography are all around us; in our homes, gardens, even hidden in the objects that are used to decorate them. This is why this form of photography is so accessible to people regardless of age or skill; a form of photography that has no boundaries.View fullsizewater abstractTHAT ANYONE CAN EXPERIENCE…Abstract photography is homes, gardens, even hidden in the objects that are used to decorate them. This is why this form of photography is so accessible to people regardless of age or skill; a form of photography that has no boundaries.View fullsizewater abstractTHAT ANYONE CAN EXPERIENCE…Abstract photography is so diverse and obtainable, that with the right know-how, anyone can succeed in creating wonderful shots, giving us a unique view into the unknown. One of the many wonders of abstract photography is that you can take one subject and transform it into something original, something that will captivate the minds of all those who look upon it, evoking their emotions.What most photographers tend to focus on is the colours, shapes and angles of a shot; which is true in any form of photography. However with abstract photography the end reaction is far more emotional and more deeply felt than regular photographs. By utilising these three features, you have the potential to truly discover the beauty of this art. An art I can help you perfect…AND YOU CAN STEP INTO IT TODAY.You can learn the secrets about what makes abstract images work well by joining my abstract photography course starting this March. I can guide you through the world of abstract photography so you can experience the wonders of this marvellous venture.View fullsizeoil and water abstractnews Alan Ranger 0 Tumblr 0 Likes",
