The Assignment Technical Focus • Use a tripod to stabilize your camera and avoid motion blur; set your aperture to f/8, shutter speed to 1/60s, ISO 100 in manual mode. • Experiment with different focal lengths; try using a 50mm lens at f/4, 1/125s, ISO 200 to create a pleasing depth of field. • Adjust white balance to match your light source; set it to 'Daylight' for natural light or 'Tungsten' for indoor lighting. • Use spot metering to ensure proper exposure on the subject; set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/5.6, 1/80s, ISO 400. • Take test shots and adjust exposure compensation to +1 or -1 as necessary to avoid clipping highlights or shadows. Creative Focus • Incorporate the rule of thirds to create dynamic compositions in your still life images. • Experiment with layering textures and varying heights to add depth to your arrangement. • Use negative space intentionally to draw attention to your main subject. • Explore different angles and perspectives to find the most compelling view of your still life. • Utilize props or additional elements to tell a story or enhance the theme of your arrangement. Assignment Tasks • Arrange a group of three to five related objects on a tabletop; shoot at f/8, 1/60s, ISO 100 in manual mode to achieve sharp focus and depth. • Create a still life scene using natural light from a window; set your camera to f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 200, and use a reflector to bounce light onto the objects. • Experiment with different artificial light sources, positioning a softbox at 45°; shoot at f/4, 1/80s, ISO 400 in manual mode to create dramatic shadows. • Incorporate a white bounce card to fill in shadows; set your camera to f/8, 1/60s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode while adjusting the card's position. • Take a series of photos from slightly different angles; use f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 200 to maintain consistent exposure and focus. • Create a monochromatic still life arrangement using objects of similar color; shoot at f/11, 1/30s, ISO 100 in manual mode to enhance texture details. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Develop a themed still life series focusing on a specific color palette; ensure consistent lighting and shoot at f/8, 1/60s, ISO 100. • Collaborate with another photographer to create contrasting still life images; experiment with different lighting techniques and camera settings. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do use a tripod for stability and consistency in your shots. • ✓ Do test different camera settings to find what works best for your specific scene. • ✓ Do pay attention to the arrangement of objects and their relationship to one another. • ✓ Do keep your background simple to avoid distractions from the main subject. • ✓ Do review your images regularly to assess composition and exposure. DON'T • ✗ Don't overcrowd your composition with too many objects. • ✗ Don't ignore the importance of lighting; it can make or break your still life image. • ✗ Don't forget to clean your objects to avoid dust and fingerprints. • ✗ Don't use mixed lighting sources without adjusting your white balance. • ✗ Don't rush the setup; take your time to arrange and style your still life effectively. Reflection Questions • What emotions did you aim to evoke through your still life arrangement? • How did the choice of lighting affect the mood of your photographs? • What challenges did you face while arranging your still life, and how did you overcome them? • In what ways did your camera settings influence the final outcome of your images? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Still Life Photography • → Composition In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
