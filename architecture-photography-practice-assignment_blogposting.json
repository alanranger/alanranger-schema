It combines technical precision with artistic vision to convey the character and story behind architectural designs.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the principles of composition specific to architecture photography. * Master the use of light and shadow to enhance architectural features. * Develop skills in using camera settings effectively for architecture photography.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Scout locations to identify interesting architectural features and compositions. * Check the weather forecast to plan for optimal lighting conditions. * Prepare your gear, ensuring your camera battery is charged and memory cards are empty. * Research architectural styles and elements to focus on during your shoot. * Plan your shooting schedule around the golden hour for softer light.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use a wide-angle len . * Prepare your gear, ensuring your camera battery is charged and memory cards are empty. * Research architectural styles and elements to focus on during your shoot. * Plan your shooting schedule around the golden hour for softer light.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use a wide-angle lens (e.g., 16-35mm) at f/8, 1/125s, ISO 100 in manual mode to capture expansive cityscapes with minimal distortion. * Shoot in aperture priority mode at f/11, 1/60s, ISO 200 to achieve a deep depth of field for detailed architectural shots. * Utilize a tripod to stabilize your camera for long exposure shots at f/16, 15s, ISO 100 to capture light trails from moving vehicles near buildings. * Set your camera to manual focus to ensure sharpness on key architectural features, using f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 400. * Experiment with HDR photography by taking three bracketed shots at f/8, 1/30s, ISO 100 to balance highlights and shadows in high-contrast scenes.CREATIVE FOCUS * Incorporate leading lines to draw the viewer's eye towards the building's focal point. * Use reflections in glass surfaces or water to create dynamic compositions. * Capture architectural details (like doorways or windows) to tell a story about the building's history. * Experiment with different angles and perspectives to present unique views of familiar structures. * Include human elements in your shots to provide scale and context to the architecture.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Photograph a local skyscraper at dusk using f/8, 1/60s, ISO 200 in manual mode to capture the building illuminated against the twilight sky. 2. Take close-up shots of architectural details like door handles or stone carvings at f/4, 1/125s, ISO 400 to emphasize textures. 3. Shoot a historic building during the golden hour at f/11, 1/30s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode to enhance warm lighting. 4. Capture a series of images of a modern building from various angles using f/5.6, 1/200s, ISO 200 to showcase its design elements. 5. Create a panoramic shot of a city skyline at f/8, 1/15s, ISO 100 on a tripod to ensure stability and clarity. 6. Document the construction phase of a building at f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 400 to highlight the process and materials used.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a time-lapse video of a building from sunrise to sunset, adjusting settings to maintain consistent exposure. * Experiment with night photography by capturing illuminated buildings at f/2.8, 10s, ISO 800 to explore low-light conditions.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do use a tripod for stability in low-light conditions. * ✓ Do experiment with different times of day to capture varying light conditions. * ✓ Do pay attention to your composition and framing before taking the shot. * ✓ Do take multiple shots of the same scene with different settings to explore options. * ✓ Do engage with the environment by incorporating people or movement in your images.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely solely on automatic settings; learn to use manual controls for better results. * ✗ Don't shoot in harsh midday light without considering shadows; aim for softer light. * ✗ Don't forget to check your camera settings before starting your shoot. * ✗ Don't ignore the background; ensure it complements the architectural subject. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to find the best angles and compositions.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What challenges did you face while shooting architecture, and how did you overcome them? * How did different lighting c ignore the background; ensure it complements the architectural subject. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to find the best angles and compositions.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What challenges did you face while shooting architecture, and how did you overcome them? * How did different lighting conditions affect the mood of your architectural photographs? * What composition techniques worked best for you in capturing architectural details? * In what ways did including people in your shots change the narrative of your images?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → Architecture Photography Guide * → What Are Leading Lines In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
