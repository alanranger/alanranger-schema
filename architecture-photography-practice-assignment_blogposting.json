The Assignment Technical Focus • Use a wide-angle lens (e.g., 16-35mm) at f/8, 1/125s, ISO 100 in manual mode to capture expansive cityscapes with minimal distortion. • Shoot in aperture priority mode at f/11, 1/60s, ISO 200 to achieve a deep depth of field for detailed architectural shots. • Utilize a tripod to stabilize your camera for long exposure shots at f/16, 15s, ISO 100 to capture light trails from moving vehicles near buildings. • Set your camera to manual focus to ensure sharpness on key architectural features, using f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 400. • Experiment with HDR photography by taking three bracketed shots at f/8, 1/30s, ISO 100 to balance highlights and shadows in high-contrast scenes. Creative Focus • Incorporate leading lines to draw the viewer's eye towards the building's focal point. • Use reflections in glass surfaces or water to create dynamic compositions. • Capture architectural details (like doorways or windows) to tell a story about the building's history. • Experiment with different angles and perspectives to present unique views of familiar structures. • Include human elements in your shots to provide scale and context to the architecture. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a local skyscraper at dusk using f/8, 1/60s, ISO 200 in manual mode to capture the building illuminated against the twilight sky. • Take close-up shots of architectural details like door handles or stone carvings at f/4, 1/125s, ISO 400 to emphasize textures. • Shoot a historic building during the golden hour at f/11, 1/30s, ISO 100 in aperture priority mode to enhance warm lighting. • Capture a series of images of a modern building from various angles using f/5.6, 1/200s, ISO 200 to showcase its design elements. • Create a panoramic shot of a city skyline at f/8, 1/15s, ISO 100 on a tripod to ensure stability and clarity. • Document the construction phase of a building at f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 400 to highlight the process and materials used. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a time-lapse video of a building from sunrise to sunset, adjusting settings to maintain consistent exposure. • Experiment with night photography by capturing illuminated buildings at f/2.8, 10s, ISO 800 to explore low-light conditions. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do use a tripod for stability in low-light conditions. • ✓ Do experiment with different times of day to capture varying light conditions. • ✓ Do pay attention to your composition and framing before taking the shot. • ✓ Do take multiple shots of the same scene with different settings to explore options. • ✓ Do engage with the environment by incorporating people or movement in your images. DON'T • ✗ Don't rely solely on automatic settings; learn to use manual controls for better results. • ✗ Don't shoot in harsh midday light without considering shadows; aim for softer light. • ✗ Don't forget to check your camera settings before starting your shoot. • ✗ Don't ignore the background; ensure it complements the architectural subject. • ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to find the best angles and compositions. Reflection Questions • What challenges did you face while shooting architecture, and how did you overcome them? • How did different lighting conditions affect the mood of your architectural photographs? • What composition techniques worked best for you in capturing architectural details? • In what ways did including people in your shots change the narrative of your images? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → Architecture Photography Guide • → What Are Leading Lines In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
