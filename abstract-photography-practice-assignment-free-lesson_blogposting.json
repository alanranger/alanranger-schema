Through specific shooting tasks, learners will explore creative compositions and develop their unique artistic style.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the principles of abstract photography focusing on visual elements. * Experiment with different compositions and techniques to create abstract images. * Develop a personal style by critically evaluating and reflecting on their work.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a location with interesting patterns or textures, such as an urban setting or natural landscape. * Gather a variety of objects to photograph close-up, focusing on their shapes and textures. * Set your camera to aperture priority mode with a fixed ISO of 200. * Familiarize yourself with the rule of thirds and negative space concepts. * Prepare to experiment with light and shadow by selecting different times of day fo ects to photograph close-up, focusing on their shapes and textures. * Set your camera to aperture priority mode with a fixed ISO of 200. * Familiarize yourself with the rule of thirds and negative space concepts. * Prepare to experiment with light and shadow by selecting different times of day for shooting.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field and isolate subjects. * Incorporate intentional camera movement to create dynamic abstract effects. * Experiment with macro photography to capture fine details of everyday objects. * Explore the effects of backlighting to enhance shapes and textures. * Use a tripod to stabilize your shots during longer exposures for smooth abstract images.CREATIVE FOCUS * Seek inspiration in mundane objects around your environment to find abstract potential. * Play with reflections in water or glass to create layered images. * Use color contrasts to evoke emotions and add depth to your images. * Capture shadows and silhouettes to emphasize shapes and forms. * Experiment with different angles and perspectives to challenge traditional viewpoints.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Find a textured surface (like a wall or fabric) and shoot a close-up image using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed to create depth. 2. Capture an abstract image of moving water, using shutter priority mode at 1/100s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze the motion. 3. Photograph a collection of everyday objects from above, ensuring to fill the frame with shapes, using aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. 4. Use intentional camera movement while shooting a busy street scene, using shutter priority mode at 1/30s with ISO 200 fixed to create a sense of motion. 5. Create an abstract image focusing on light and shadow by shooting through a translucent material using aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed. 6. Find an urban environment with patterns (like pavement or buildings) and shoot from a low angle, using aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed to capture depth.💡 Stretch Tasks * Develop a series of 5 images that tell a story through abstract photography, using various techniques learned in this assignment. * Create a photo collage of your abstract images, focusing on color and shape relationships to convey a theme.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do explore different locations for varied abstract opportunities. * ✓ Do take multiple shots from different angles to find the most compelling composition. * ✓ Do adjust your framing to include negative space for a more balanced composition. * ✓ Do review and edit your photos to enhance colors and contrast after the shoot. * ✓ Do seek feedback from peers or mentors to gain insights into your abstract work.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely on literal representations; focus on the essence of the subject instead. * ✗ Don't be afraid to experiment; failure can lead to unexpected and rewarding results. * ✗ Don't shoot in direct sunlight without considering shadows, as they can overwhelm your composition. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of composition; the arrangement of elements is crucial in abstract photography. * ✗ Don't use too many elements in one frame; simplicity often leads to stronger abstract images.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What emotions did your abstract images evoke, and why do you think that is? * How did experimenting with different techniques influence your perspective on abstract",
