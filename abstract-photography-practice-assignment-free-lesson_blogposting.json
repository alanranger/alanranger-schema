The Assignment Technical Focus • Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field and isolate subjects. • Incorporate intentional camera movement to create dynamic abstract effects. • Experiment with macro photography to capture fine details of everyday objects. • Explore the effects of backlighting to enhance shapes and textures. • Use a tripod to stabilize your shots during longer exposures for smooth abstract images. Creative Focus • Seek inspiration in mundane objects around your environment to find abstract potential. • Play with reflections in water or glass to create layered images. • Use color contrasts to evoke emotions and add depth to your images. • Capture shadows and silhouettes to emphasize shapes and forms. • Experiment with different angles and perspectives to challenge traditional viewpoints. Assignment Tasks • Find a textured surface (like a wall or fabric) and shoot a close-up image using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed to create depth. • Capture an abstract image of moving water, using shutter priority mode at 1/100s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze the motion. • Photograph a collection of everyday objects from above, ensuring to fill the frame with shapes, using aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. • Use intentional camera movement while shooting a busy street scene, using shutter priority mode at 1/30s with ISO 200 fixed to create a sense of motion. • Create an abstract image focusing on light and shadow by shooting through a translucent material using aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed. • Find an urban environment with patterns (like pavement or buildings) and shoot from a low angle, using aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed to capture depth. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Develop a series of 5 images that tell a story through abstract photography, using various techniques learned in this assignment. • Create a photo collage of your abstract images, focusing on color and shape relationships to convey a theme. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do explore different locations for varied abstract opportunities. • ✓ Do take multiple shots from different angles to find the most compelling composition. • ✓ Do adjust your framing to include negative space for a more balanced composition. • ✓ Do review and edit your photos to enhance colors and contrast after the shoot. • ✓ Do seek feedback from peers or mentors to gain insights into your abstract work. DON'T • ✗ Don't rely on literal representations; focus on the essence of the subject instead. • ✗ Don't be afraid to experiment; failure can lead to unexpected and rewarding results. • ✗ Don't shoot in direct sunlight without considering shadows, as they can overwhelm your composition. • ✗ Don't ignore the importance of composition; the arrangement of elements is crucial in abstract photography. • ✗ Don't use too many elements in one frame; simplicity often leads to stronger abstract images. Reflection Questions • What emotions did your abstract images evoke, and why do you think that is? • How did experimenting with different techniques influence your perspective on abstract photography? • What challenges did you face while shooting, and how did you overcome them? • In what ways do you think your unique style is developing through this assignment? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → Mastering Abstract Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
