There is lots of theory that really helps build the foundation before you can start to put that into practice.   I found Alan really high energy and passionate about photography, which meant I came away feeling like I'd learnt a lot and excited about using my new knowledge.  Also, seeing as I was attending at almost 9months pregnant the fact he kept my attention until 10pm is no mean feat, I'm normally asleep by 9.30!!!",
