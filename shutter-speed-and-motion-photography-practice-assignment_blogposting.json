The Assignment Technical Focus • Use a fast shutter speed of 1/1000s at f/4, ISO 200 in shutter priority mode to freeze motion of a running athlete. • Set a slow shutter speed of 1/4s at f/8, ISO 100 in manual mode to capture light trails from moving vehicles. • Employ a shutter speed of 1/30s at f/5.6, ISO 800 in aperture priority mode to create motion blur while panning with a moving subject. • Adjust shutter speed to 1/60s at f/3.5, ISO 400 in program mode to capture a dancer in motion with some blur. • Utilize a shutter speed of 2s at f/11, ISO 100 in manual mode to create a smooth blur effect in waterfall photography. Creative Focus • Experiment with intentional camera movement (ICM) by moving your camera during a long exposure to create abstract images. • Try zooming in or out while shooting at a slow shutter speed to create a dynamic sense of motion in your photographs. • Capture subjects in motion against a stationary background to emphasize speed and action. • Use silhouettes against a sunset backdrop with a fast shutter speed to create dramatic imagery. • Combine multiple exposures in post-processing to showcase different stages of motion in a single frame. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a cyclist racing past you at f/5.6, 1/1000s, ISO 200 in shutter priority mode to freeze their motion. • Capture a waterfall with a slow shutter speed of f/8, 1/2s, ISO 100 in manual mode to create a silky water effect. • Shoot a moving train at f/4, 1/500s, ISO 400 in aperture priority mode to freeze the train while blurring the background. • Use a shutter speed of 1/30s at f/3.2, ISO 800 in manual mode to capture a street performer with motion blur. • Photograph a busy street scene at f/11, 1/4s, ISO 100 in manual mode to show light trails from passing cars. • Capture a soccer player kicking a ball at f/2.8, 1/2000s, ISO 400 in shutter priority mode to freeze the action. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create an abstract image using ICM by moving the camera vertically during a 1s exposure at f/16, ISO 100. • Shoot a time-lapse sequence of a sunset with varying shutter speeds to capture the changing light and motion. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do practice with different shutter speeds to see how they affect motion. • ✓ Do use a tripod for long exposure shots to maintain stability. • ✓ Do experiment with different focal lengths to alter the perception of speed. • ✓ Do adjust your ISO settings to compensate for changing light conditions. • ✓ Do review your images and make adjustments based on the results. DON'T • ✗ Don't use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod, as it may result in unwanted blur. • ✗ Don't forget to set your white balance according to the lighting conditions. • ✗ Don't shoot in automatic mode if you want full control over your shutter speed. • ✗ Don't neglect to check your histogram to ensure proper exposure. • ✗ Don't be afraid to experiment; some of the best shots come from unexpected settings. Reflection Questions • How did changing shutter speed affect the way motion was captured in your images? • What challenges did you face when trying to freeze or blur motion? • Which techniques did you find most effective for conveying movement? • How might you apply your understanding of shutter speed in future photography projects? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Shutter Speed For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
