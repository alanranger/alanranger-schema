Students will explore how composition, subject matter, and stylistic elements can work in unison to tell a story or present a theme.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the concept and structure of a triptych in photography. * Develop skills in composing images that work together visually and thematically. * Experiment with different styles and perspectives to enhance storytelling in photography.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Choose a narrative or theme that you want to explore in your triptych. * Scout locations that fit your chosen theme and visualize how each panel will relate to one another. * Gather props or subjects that will help convey your story across the three images. * Plan your shooting schedule to ensure you have adequate time for each panel. * Review the principles of composition and how they can be applied to tri me and visualize how each panel will relate to one another. * Gather props or subjects that will help convey your story across the three images. * Plan your shooting schedule to ensure you have adequate time for each panel. * Review the principles of composition and how they can be applied to triptychs.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed for optimal exposure. * Consider using a tripod to maintain consistent framing across all three images. * Experiment with depth of field by adjusting aperture to emphasize your subject in each panel. * Ensure proper lighting for each shot to maintain a cohesive tone throughout the triptych. * Think about the angles and perspectives that will create a visual flow from one image to the next.CREATIVE FOCUS * Explore how color palettes can unify your triptych and create emotional resonance. * Use leading lines in your compositions to guide the viewer's eye across the three panels. * Incorporate contrasting elements in each image to highlight the narrative or theme. * Experiment with different focal lengths to add variety while maintaining coherence. * Think about the relationship between the left and right images and how they point to the center image.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Create three images that together tell a story of growth: the beginning, middle, and end stages of a plant's life cycle, using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed. 2. Photograph a triptych representing a day in the life of a city, capturing the morning, afternoon, and evening scenes, using aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed. 3. Document a personal journey or experience in three parts, ensuring each image reflects a different emotional state, using shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed. 4. Capture three related objects that represent a theme of change, ensuring each image has a distinct perspective while maintaining coherence, using aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed. 5. Photograph a dynamic event in three stages: the buildup, the climax, and the aftermath, using shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed. 6. Create a triptych that explores a color theme, with each panel focusing on a different shade while maintaining a cohesive subject, using aperture priority mode at f/5 with ISO 200 fixed.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of triptychs that explore the same theme but through different photographic techniques, such as long exposure versus freeze motion. * Collaborate with another photographer to each create triptychs from the same subject matter, comparing styles and interpretations.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do plan each shot with the relationship between images in mind. * ✓ Do experiment with different times of day for varied lighting conditions. * ✓ Do ensure that your images are displayed in a way that highlights their connection. * ✓ Do consider the viewer's perspective when composing your images. * ✓ Do take multiple shots for each panel to have options during editing.DON'T * ✗ Don't select unrelated subjects for your triptych. * ✗ Don't neglect the importance of visual flow between the images. * ✗ Don't rely solely on post-editing to create coherence; focus on composition during shooting. * ✗ Don't forget to maintain a consistent style across all three images. * ✗ Don't rush the process; take your time to plan each photograph. t neglect the importance of visual flow between the images. * ✗ Don't rely solely on post-editing to create coherence; focus on composition during shooting. * ✗ Don't forget to maintain a consistent style across all three images. * ✗ Don't rush the process; take your time to plan each photograph.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What narrative did you aim to convey through your triptych, and how did each image contribute to that story? * How did the use of color and composition enhance the connection between your three images? * In what ways did the triptych format challenge your usual approach to photography? * How did the relationships between the left, center, and right images influence your creative decisions?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → The Art Of Storytelling Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
