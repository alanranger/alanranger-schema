With the release of Nik Collection 7, this suite of powerful editing tools, including essential plugins, has undergone a significant update, promising to redefine the boundaries of visual creativity. This comprehensive article delves into the key features, improvements, and surprises that come with the latest iteration of the Nik Collection by DxO, empowering you to make an informed decision on whether this update, enriched with new plugins, is worth the investment. From speed enhancements and workflow optimizations to the introduction of cutting-edge selection tools, we'll explore how Nik Collection 7 can elevate your photography to new heights. The Nik Collection: A Snapshot The Nik software is a renowned suite of seven photo editing tools, each catering to a specific aspect of the creative process. This comprehensive toolkit includes Nik Silver Efex for black and white photography and Nik Color Efex for analog photography effects. • Color Efex Silver Efex (Nik Silver Efex) Analog Efex (Nik Analog Efex) Viveza (Nik Viveza) Dfine (Nik Dfine) HDR Efex (Nik HDR Efex) Sharpener (Nik Sharpener) providing photographers with diverse capabilities and plugins to enhance their work. Historically, the Nik Collection has been praised for its ability to seamlessly integrate with leading photo editing software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom Classic, DxO PhotoLab, and Serif Affinity. This makes it a go-to choice for photographers of all skill levels, from hobbyists to professionals. This cross-platform compatibility, bolstered by essential plugins, ensures wide-reaching applicability. Nik Collection 7: A Significant Upgrade With the release of Nik Collection 7, DxO has introduced a host of enhancements that promise to elevate the user experience and unlock new creative possibilities. Let's dive into the key updates, including new plugins, that set this version apart from its predecessors. Speed and Workflow Improvements One of the most notable improvements in Nik Collection 7 by DxO is the significant boost in performance across the board. The suite, now up to 30% faster in opening files, whether as a standalone application or when accessed as a plugin within a host program, translates to a more efficient and streamlined editing workflow, allowing photographers to spend more time on the creative process and less time waiting for their tools to load. Furthermore, Nik Collection 7 introduces a new Quick Search feature, enabling users to quickly locate and access their custom presets and filters. This enhancement, coupled with improved organization of these assets, ensures that photographers can effortlessly find the plugins and tools they need to bring their creative vision to life. Enhanced U Point Local Adjustment Tool The Nik Collection's renowned U Point technology, which allows for targeted and intelligent adjustments, has received a significant upgrade in Version 7. The update introduces three new selection tools, including polygonal masks, elliptical control points, and advanced masking tools, providing photographers with greater precision and flexibility when making local adjustments. Firstly, the Polygonal Tool empowers users to quickly create intricate, irregular selections, breaking free from the confines of the previously available circular control points. Secondly, the ability to modify the elliptical properties of these control points offers a more versatile approach to targeted adjustments. Lastly, the incorporation of Luminosity Masks expands the tool's capabilities, enabling photographers to precisely target brightness levels within their images, thanks to the advanced polygonal masks, elliptical control points, and masking tools. These advancements in U Point technology elevate the Nik Collection's local adjustment capabilities, catering to a broader range of workflows and creative needs, and solidifying its position as a must-have suite of plugins for selective adjustments. Nik Color Efex: The Flagship's Enhancements While the entire Nik Collection suite has seen numerous enhancements, the Nik Color Efex plugin, alongside Nik Viveza and other plugins, has been the primary focus of the update. This flagship tool is celebrated for its vast array of filter effects and creative possibilities, which have been further augmented in Nik Collection 7, including improved HSL controls. The introduction of an Extended Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity (HSL) filter, part of the suite's HSL controls, allows for more precise color adjustments. This empowers photographers to fine-tune specific color ranges within their images. Additionally, the inclusion of a new Vibrancy slider offers users enhanced control over the vibrancy and punch of their edits, marking a significant advancement in color enhancements. A standout feature in Nik Color Efex 7 is the 'stacking' capability, which enables users to combine and reorder a multitude of filters for achieving their desired creative effects. This level of customization, coupled with a non-destructive editing workflow, further cements the plugin's status as a formidable tool for visual expression. Parallel Installation and Perspective Efex Removal While most updates in Nik Collection 7 have been positively received, the removal of the Perspective Efex plugin, a tool cherished for its optical distortion correction and perspective adjustment capabilities, has been met with some disappointment. This tool was a valuable asset for photographers looking to simulate tilt-shift photography or correct wide-angle distortions, and its absence is noted despite the suite's overall enhancements. DxO has explained that the decision to prioritize a faster and smoother workflow led to the discontinuation of Perspective Efex. Nevertheless, the company has offered a parallel installation option, allowing users of previous Nik Collection versions to continue utilizing the Perspective Efex plugin alongside the new Version 7 release, ensuring they can still enjoy the comprehensive range of plugins. Pricing and Availability Nik Collection 7, now available for purchase directly from the DxO website, offers a full suite version priced at $159. Existing users have the opportunity to upgrade from previous versions for $89. DxO also provides a free 30-day trial, inviting photographers to explore the new features and capabilities before making a purchase decision. User Feedback and Reactions The release of Nik Collection 7 has sparked a variety of responses from the photography community. Many users have embraced the speed improvements and enhanced selection tools, though the removal of the Perspective Efex plugin has sparked debate among some. The price increase for Nik Collection 7 has been a point of contention for some photographers, especially considering the relatively modest scope of updates compared to previous iterations. However, many have lauded the suite's ongoing evolution, highlighting that core creative tools like Nik Color Efex and Nik Silver Efex continue to set industry standards and represent a worthwhile investment. Nik Collection 7: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Creative Photographers In the dynamic world of photo editing software, Nik Collection 7 distinguishes itself as a comprehensive toolkit catering to the varied needs of creative photographers. With enhancements in speed, workflow optimizations, and advancements in local adjustment capabilities, this latest version promises to refine the editing experience and open new avenues for visual creativity. Although the removal of the Perspective Efex plugin has raised concerns, the parallel installation option offers a practical solution for those wishing to retain this feature. Moreover, the suite's cross-platform compatibility and perpetual licensing model affirm Nik Collection 7's status as a valuable asset for photographers in search of a powerful and adaptable editing solution. As the photography industry continues to evolve, the Nik Collection 7, powered by DxO, stands as a testament to the brand's commitment to empowering visual artists.
