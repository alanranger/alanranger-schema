From the vibrant colours of falling leaves to the misty mornings and dramatic sunsets, the UK offers many opportunities for stunning autumn landscape photography. Photographing autumn is a key highlight in the year for most landscape photographers; however, it does require some preparation to make the most of the season. Autumn photography can be unpredictable regarding when the colours are at their peak. Then, with our seemingly more unpredictable seasonal weather, we must create the time to ensure we can align those windows of opportunity.My workshop schedule is at its busiest period from late September to early December for this very reason, and the weather can sometimes mean postponement, rescheduling and flexibility to meet nature’s timing and working around storms and rain. Autumn 2023 has been one of these years, with warmer temperatures delaying autumn colour and, more recently, torrential levels of rain, causing flooding, disruption, and even a threat to lives in some areas. Several of my events had to be changed over the last 4 weeks for these reasons. However, I have managed to cram an awful lot into the previous six weeks, from the Lake District to Snowdonia, to Dartmoor to Gloucestershire (for my annual Batsford Arboretum events) to the Peak District and this weekend to the Yorkshire Dales before I return to the Peak District again later this month and finish off the season in Suffolk at the end of this month. It’s been an absolute pleasure meeting new clients throughout this period and welcoming existing clients back. There are still more events for you to join for photographing autumn with me at Batsford if you want personalised support, tuition and experienced location knowledge to make the most of this time of year. Please take a look at my remaining autumn photography workshops. I have made too many images over the last six weeks to include in this post, so show some of my personal favourites so far from this period. You can see all my latest photos here; there are many more that I have yet to edit and post, so I will add those when time allows. If you can’t make my events or prefer your DIY option, this site is a valuable resource for places that are less rugged and wild. https://www.greatbritishgardens.co.uk/seasonal/autumn-tints.html View fullsize Photographing Autumn: UK Landscape Photography Guide by Alan Ranger PhotographyAutumn is arguably the most enchanting time of year to capture the beauty of the UK landscape through photography. The vibrant hues of orange, yellow, and red create a spectacle that is hard to resist for any passionate landscape photographer. In this guide to photographing autumn, we will explore some tips and advice to help you make the most of your autumn photography adventures in the UK. Every tree is unique and will be affected by multiple factors of light, soil, temperature, age and more. However, the botanical typical order of the common British woodland species is as follows from earliest to latest. Four Stages of AutumnPhase 1: Green The green leaves you see throughout summer already contain most of the colours of autumn! Throughout most of the year the colours of autumn are ‘covered’ by the dominant green chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps trees to absorb the energy of the sunlight - the tree is essentially 'charging' during the summer months. Chlorophyll changes carbon dioxide (CO2) + water (H2O) into sugars which 'feed' the tree. Why is chlorophyll green? Chlorophyll is green because it allows trees to absorb blue and yellow wavelengths from the light, but not the green which is reflected back. Phase 2: Turning Yellow As the weather cools in autumn, the leaves receive less sunlight. Less sunlight triggers chlorophyll to break down (and the tree does not replenish it), revealing the new, colourful pigments underneath and treating us to beautiful autumn yellows and oranges. The yellows and oranges previously masked by chlorophyll are called xanthophylls and carotenoids. These pigments are present year-round in the leaves but are usually hidden by the green chlorophyll. Phase 3: Fiery reds In some species and in certain special years, you'll see another stage of colour as the leaves turn a vibrant red. This is caused by anthocyanins. These reds are produced in years when lots of sunlight and dry weather have increased the concentration of sugar in tree sap, triggering the tree to release anthocyanins in an attempt to grab the last of the energy from its leaves, powering it up to get through the winter. Interestingly, freezing weather, acidic soils, and other stress factors occasionally trigger the production of higher levels of anthocyanins. Phase 4: The fall At the end of this colourful process, leaves die. Trees shed their dead leaves because they are no longer able to get energy from them through winter. By shedding their leaves, trees can survive because they make room for new growth in the spring. Trees are great at recycling! Fallen leaves contribute to the health of the forest after they fall, through decomposition. Though the tree has released them, some carbohydrates and sugars remain in the leaves. On the forest floor, these carbohydrates and sugars give nutrition for 'feeders' to flourish. Once fungi and bacteria have begun to break down the leaves, insects get in on the dinner party, too. Once the leaves are broken down, they provide a source of fibre, which helps the soil retain moisture and improve drainage. Six Tips for Photographing Autumn1. Planning Your Shoots Before setting out, it's crucial to plan your shoots in advance. Research locations that are renowned for their autumnal beauty, such as the New Forest, Lake District, Peak District, Wales or Scottish Highlands. Consider the weather conditions, as misty mornings and light rain can add a touch of magic to your photographs. Local photography guides or online resources can provide valuable insights into popular shooting spots and the best times to visit. 2. Capturing the Colours Autumn landscapes are famous for their stunning display of diverse colours. To make your photographs visually appealing, use a varied range of lens focal lengths to capture expansive scenes adorned with colourful foliage, or isolate your subject in a scene to frame small details and textures, contrast, shapes and light. Experiment with different angles and perspectives to add depth and interest to your compositions. Utilise the soft, warm, and diffused light present during the early morning or late afternoon to enhance the colours even further. Golden hour photography during autumn can produce captivating, ethereal images that will leave a lasting impression. 3. Using Filters and Accessories Maximise the impact of your autumn shots by using filters and accessories to enhance your images. Consider using a polarising filter to deepen the tones and reduce reflective glare, or a neutral density filter to create long exposures of falling leaves or rivers surrounded by autumn foliage. Utilising these tools can bring out the best in your autumn landscape photographs. 4. Exploring Textures and Patterns Autumn provides an abundance of textures and patterns to explore and capture. Look for fallen leaves on the ground, dewdrops on spiderwebs, or reflections in calm waters. These elements add interest and depth to your images, creating a visual feast for the viewer. Be patient, observant, and open to discovering hidden gems within the landscape. 5. Embracing the Changing Light During autumn, the quality and direction of light evolve, creating unique opportunities for photographers. Thick fog, mist, and low sunlight can produce enchanting and moody atmospheres. Embrace these variations in lighting to create a sense of drama and evoke emotions in your viewers. Be constantly observant about the direction of light in your environment and position yourself and your composition accordingly to create images using side light, front light, and backlight. Experiment with the light to design silhouettes or backlit subjects to add a touch of creativity to your autumn captures. 6. Telling a Story As with any landscape photography, storytelling is a powerful element that can elevate your images to the next level. Capture the essence of autumn by focusing on the intricate details, such as the fallen leaf on a mossy rock or a lone tree standing against a cloudy sky. Utilise foreground elements and visual pathways to guide the viewer's eye and create a narrative within your frame. Remember, each photograph has a story to tell - make sure yours is captivating. Conclusion to Photographing Autumn Autumn in the UK offers a wealth of opportunities for landscape photographers. By planning your shoots, capturing vibrant colours, utilising filters and accessories, exploring textures and patterns, embracing changing light, and telling a story, you can create breathtaking photographs that capture the essence of this magical season. So grab your camera, venture into the great outdoors, and let the captivating beauty of autumn unfold before your lens. Happy shooting!
