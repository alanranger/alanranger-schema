      "name": "Verdict – is the Mammoth + GD36PT the best tripod for landscape photography?Putting it all together:As a set of legs, the Benro Mammoth TMTH44C is outstanding. For landscape photography it ticks almost every box: stability, height, very low shooting positions, and a bowl that makes levelling fast. I’d happily call it one of the best tripods for landscape photography in its class, especially for serious users who aren’t counting every gram.As a head, the Benro GD36PT is a more nuanced story. The hybrid concept works well and the geared motion is lovely to use within its range, but the limited pitch movement and the snagging on the tripod mounting plate mean it doesn’t fully replace my GD3WH for more extreme compositions.If you’re building or upgrading a serious tripod for landscape photography, my honest conclusion would be:✅ Mammoth TMTH44C – highly recommended⚖️ GD36PT – good within limits, but I’d like a taller spacer and more geared range💡 GD3WH – still excellent when you need full-range geared control",
