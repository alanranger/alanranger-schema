Use aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera set shutter speed to capture a bird in flight. 2. Set your camera to shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set aperture to photograph a running deer. 3. Capture a close-up shot of a resting animal using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed to create a blurred background. 4. Photograph a group of animals interacting using shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze the action. 5. Use aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed to photograph a landscape with wildlife, ensuring both the subject and background are in focus. 6. Set shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a bird landing on a branch, letting the camera adjust the aperture.💡 Stretch Tasks * Experiment with long exposure techniques using a tripod to capture wildlife moving through a scene at dusk, while maintaining ISO 200. * Create a series of images that document the behavior of a specific animal over a period, focusing on different times of day and settings.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do be patient and wait for the right moment to capture wildlife. * ✓ Do use a tripod to stabilize your shots, especially in low-light conditions. * ✓ Do respect wildlife and maintain a safe distance to avoid disturbing them. * ✓ Do familiarize yourself with local wildlife laws and regulations regarding photography. * ✓ Do keep your gear ready and accessible for spontaneous opportunities.DON'T * ✗ Don't approach wildlife too closely, as it may stress or scare them away. * ✗ Don't use flash photography, as it can startle animals and disrupt their natural behavior. * ✗ Don't forget to check your camera settings before shooting. * ✗ Don't ignore the background in your compositions; it can make or break your shot. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take your time to observe and compose.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * What challenges did you face while trying to photograph wildlife, and how did you overcome them? * How did using priority modes change the way you approached shooting wildlife? * What did you learn about animal behavior that helped you capture better images? * How can you improve your patience and observa lenges did you face while trying to photograph wildlife, and how did you overcome them? * How did using priority modes change the way you approached shooting wildlife? * What did you learn about animal behavior that helped you capture better images? * How can you improve your patience and observational skills for future wildlife photography sessions?For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
