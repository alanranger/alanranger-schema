  "articleBody": "this article, we will explore the features and benefits of this innovative camera bag and discuss how to choose the right bag for your needs. Before we get into the details, I want to admit to being a camera bag junky - In twenty years of being an active photographer, I think I have massed the equivalent of a bag a year for my needs. Weirdly my needs haven’t changed that much over time. The quantity of gear I take out on a workshop or my own wanderings is pretty standard for the most part. However, bags age faster than me with exposure to all weather conditions and bundled in and out of the car, on my back, or the ground. Sometimes I want to travel with one lens and maybe a couple of accessories, filters, spare battery, water bottle, lunch box etc. other times, I want to take two or even three lenses and more. So, over the years, I have leaned towards having two types of camera bags. Though I still constantly question whether there is something in between that does it all. I’ve not found it yet but have come close to it with my current main bag. Which I am more than happy with to date. • Small but big enough to carry a camera body and one lens, plus a small amount of accessories and a water bottle. The day pack. Large but still convenient for weight, comfort, space and versatility. i.e. I can include clothing (hat, gloves, jacket), a flask and a water bottle, filters, and other accessories. The review of this bag falls into the first category of the all-day, one-day type, where you need a range of options for multiple lenses, filters and other equipment and clothing. Therefore a 15ltr - 25ltr capacity is usually adequate. This bag falls in the middle of this range at 18.5ltr volume. How to Choose the Right Camera Bag for You When selecting a camera bag, it's essential to consider your specific needs and requirements. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing the right bag for you: Key Camera Bag Requirements Protection of gear: Ensure the bag offers adequate padding and protection for your valuable equipment. Comfort and weight: Look for a bag with an ergonomic design and padded straps to minimize strain during transport. Versatility and space: Consider the gear you need to carry and ensure the bag offers enough compartments and access points to accommodate your needs. Overall size: If you travel frequently, ensure the bag meets carry-on luggage standards for your preferred airline or has so much space that you overpack it and damage your back. Quality of materials: Opt for a bag made from high-quality, durable materials to ensure longevity and performance. I should probably add a sixth point - Cost but when you consider the cost of your gear running into the thousands very quickly these days, I don’t think spending 10% of that on a decent bag to protect it and use it as you want to is something to be compromised. Review of the Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack IIIthe FeaturesProtection of Gear One of the most critical aspects of a camera bag is its protection of your valuable photography equipment. Manfrotto has considered this with the Advanced Fast Backpack III, featuring their new M-Guard™ Protection System. This system uses high-density EVA foam to provide exceptional shock absorption and a slim profile for added space efficiency. M-Guard™ Protection System The M-Guard™ Protection System in the Advanced Fast Backpack III ensures that your gear remains safe and secure during transport. The customized folding patterns of the foam padding allow for maximum versatility and protection while maximizing the use of space within the bag. Comfort and Weight Another essential factor when selecting a camera bag is the comfort it provides, especially during long hours of shooting or traveling. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed with padded shoulder straps and a comfortable back panel to ensure that carrying your gear is a breeze. Ergonomic Design The ergonomic design of the backpack helps distribute weight evenly, reducing the strain on your shoulders and back. This is particularly important for landscape photographers who often have to hike long distances with their equipment. Versatility and Space The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed to be extremely versatile, with multiple access points and compartments to accommodate a wide range of gear. The bag can hold a full-frame mirrorless camera with an attached 70-200 mm f/4 lens, three additional lenses, a flash, and a 15-inch laptop. Dual Side Access and Quick Top Access The backpack features dual side access to the main gear compartment, as well as quick top access for additional space. This allows you to easily retrieve your equipment without having to completely open the bag. The top compartment can be used for personal items or a second camera body, depending on your needs. Overall Size The overall size of the camera bag is crucial for photographers who need to travel frequently or carry their gear over long distances. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed to meet the standard for carry-on luggage, allowing you to bring it on board most flights without any issues. Cabin Luggage Compatibility Due to ever-changing restrictions, it's essential to check with your airline before departure. However, the Advanced Fast Backpack III is designed to fit within most carry-on luggage limitations, making it a convenient choice for photographers on the go. Manfrotto Backpack - Quality of Materials The materials used in a camera bag play a significant role in its durability and performance. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III is made from high-quality, water-repellant fabric, ensuring your gear stays dry even in adverse weather conditions. Manfrotto Backpack - Water Repellent Fabric and Rain Cover The external fabric of the backpack is treated to repel water, and the bag also comes with an included rain cover for additional protection. This ensures that your equipment remains safe and dry, even in the most challenging environments. Manfrotto Backpack - Additional Features The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III boasts several additional features that make it an excellent choice for photographers of all levels. Manfrotto Backpack - External Tripod Connections The bag comes with proper connections to attach your tripod externally, ensuring you can bring along all the necessary equipment for your shoot. Manfrotto Backpack - Interchangeable Dividers The backpack includes modular and easy-to-use dividers that allow you to custom-fit the interior of the bag to accommodate your specific gear. This ensures that everything remains secure and organized during transport. Manfrotto Backpack - Laptop Compartment The Advanced Fast Backpack III features a dedicated, padded compartment for a 15-inch laptop, ensuring your computer stays safe during transport. Manfrotto Backpack - Tablet Compartment In addition to the laptop compartment, the bag also includes a dedicated compartment for a tablet, providing even more versatility for photographers who need to stay connected on the go. Manfrotto Backpack - Trolley Connection For easy transportation, the backpack features a designated strap connector that slides over any standard trolley or luggage handle. This makes navigating airports and other busy environments much more manageable. Testing in the flesh I approached the review of this bag with the parameters of whether it would provide what is needed for a one-day day trip or equivalent. My criteria for that would be: Camera body and two or three lenses Filters (Kase Revolution) ND’s and Polariser. A rain jacket Lunch Box & snacks Two Flasks - of water and coffee Spare battery and a small number of other accessories I packed the Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III accordingly It’s worth saying up-front that this is an 18.5ltr capacity bag, so it’s fair to say that you can pack a lot of gear into something similar to most laptop/work backpacks. However, I struggled to get everything needed into such a small space without compromising on ease of access and protection. Let’s walk through the negatives and positives. Negatives - Manfrotto Backpack Access & Opening - I wouldn’t say I like the front opening access to the camera section - the butterfly design means accessing anything in that area exposes everything to the elements, wind, rain and dust. If your bag were lying on an uneven surface, there would undoubtedly be a risk of items rolling out. Why all bags are not clamshell openings so the back of the pack that goes onto to your back is kept dry and clean is a mystery to me. Width - with only 27cm internal width, my mirrorless body with a mount converter and 70-200mm lens was butted up tight to both sides of the bag. I tried switching the configuration of the dividers but couldn’t find a convenient arrangement where everything in that section was secure and protected sufficiently. Space - whilst I could squeeze in my mirrorless body with a lens and two additional lenses, this made the side pockets redundant - I tried to fit a water bottle into the side pocket. Still, the pocket lacked expandable space, so it was impossible to use for a flask or water bottle to either side or both sides. Top Space - It’s minimal, and you can about get away with a small lunch box and cagoule-type jacket, but forget trying to pack any padded/thicker clothing in too. Positives - Manfrotto Backpack Size - The bag is compact and meets carry-on requirements so if you want to carry a limited amount of gear and accessories, you should be able to get away with using this to carry your gear. Materials - if you don’t overpack it, the bag should give you adequate protection with its sturdy internal dividers and side padding. Cost - It’s within the budget of many beginners and may work well enough as their first all-rounder bag. Summary - Manfrotto Backpack While the Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III offers some promising features, such as versatile access points, a dedicated laptop compartment, and water repellant fabric, it may not be the ideal choice for all photographers. The limited space for additional items and the front-opening design could prove to be inconvenient for those who require a more adaptable and secure camera bag. Photography Shop With over twenty years of experience and numerous camera bags tested, it is essential to prioritize the right size, quality, versatility, and accessibility when choosing a camera bag. The Manfrotto Advanced Fast Backpack III may serve some photographers well in the interim, but it may not be the perfect solution for various trips and shooting scenarios. View fullsize My Verdict Out of Five • Protection of gear: 3/5 - Awkward front opening + lack of padding to the front • Comfort and weight: 3/5 - For its size, it’s comfortable even when fully loaded, but the lack of a sternum strap seems questionable • Versatility and space: 2/5 - Deep camera section could be improved, and the internal width of 27cm restricts what you can realistically carry if you want to use side pockets. • Overall size: 4/5 - It meets carry-on requirements, and with a single body and one additional lens plus a small number of accessories, it meets the requirements • Quality of materials: 3/5 - Internal dividers are rigid, and external surfaces are okay but won’t tolerate a downpour (though a rain cover is included) or general grime and dirt.Cost - for a £100 bag it isn’t terrible but in my view isn’t fantastic either - Overall Score - 3/5 photography-tips, recommended-productsAlan Ranger31 May 2023news, reviews LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",
