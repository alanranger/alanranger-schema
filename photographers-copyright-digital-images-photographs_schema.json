It may take some time for them to scan and match infringements and generally they are only interested in a legal case on your behalf if the infringement for commercial or business use. If they find commercial infringement they will take the case on your behalf and deduct a service fee from any royalty/usage fee they receive from the offender.----------------------------------------/s/copyright-notice-digital-images-photographs-and-the-internet.pdfnews , photography-tips A educt a service fee from any royalty/usage fee they receive from the offender.----------------------------------------/s/copyright-notice-digital-images-photographs-and-the-internet.pdfnews , photography-tips Alan Ranger 28 January 2018Alan Ranger Photography news , copyright LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",
