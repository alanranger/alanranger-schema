Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Select a location with varying light conditions to practice exposure control. • Set your camera's ISO to a fixed value of 200 to ensure consistent sensitivity. • Familiarize yourself with your camera's metering modes and histogram display. • Decide whether you want to focus on depth of field or motion in your images. • Ensure your battery is charged and you have adequate storage space on your memory card. The Assignment Technical Focus • Use Aperture Priority mode for controlling depth of field while allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed. • Utilize Shutter Priority mode to freeze motion and let the camera manage aperture settings. • Check your histogram frequently to avoid clipping highlights or shadows. • Experiment with different metering modes to see how they affect exposure. • Bracket your shots when light is tricky to ensure you capture the desired exposure. Creative Focus • Explore shallow depth of field to isolate your subject from the background using a wide aperture. • Capture motion blur by using a slower shutter speed while maintaining a fixed ISO. • Use different angles and perspectives to enhance the effect of depth of field. • Incorporate foreground elements to add depth and interest to your compositions. • Experiment with backlighting to create dramatic silhouettes and contrast. Assignment Tasks • Shoot a portrait in Aperture Priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed for depth of field control. • Capture a moving subject, such as a person walking or running, in Shutter Priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera adjust the aperture. • Take a landscape photo in Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed to ensure proper exposure. • Photograph a busy street scene in Shutter Priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze motion, allowing the camera to adjust the aperture. • Experiment with low light conditions using Aperture Priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed and observe how the camera adapts the shutter speed. • Use Shutter Priority mode at 1/30s with ISO 200 fixed to creatively capture motion blur of moving water or traffic. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a series of images that demonstrate various depths of field effects using different aperture settings in Aperture Priority mode. • Challenge yourself to capture the same scene multiple times at different shutter speeds in Shutter Priority mode to compare motion effects. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do check your histogram after each shot to ensure proper exposure. • ✓ Do experiment with different metering modes to see how they affect your results. • ✓ Do take notes on the settings used for each shot to track your progress. • ✓ Do review your images critically to identify areas for improvement in exposure. • ✓ Do practice in various lighting conditions to understand how light affects exposure. DON'T • ✗ Don't shoot in fully manual mode; focus on using priority modes to master exposure. • ✗ Don't neglect to adjust your metering mode based on the scene's lighting. • ✗ Don't ignore the importance of a fixed ISO; it helps maintain consistency. • ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose and assess your exposure. • ✗ Don't forget to engage with your histogram; it’s crucial for avoiding clipping. Reflection Questions • How did using Aperture Priority mode affect your control over depth of field? • What challenges did you face when capturing motion in Shutter Priority mode? • In what ways did different metering modes influence your exposure results? • How can understanding the exposure triangle improve your overall photography skills? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Exposure In Photography • → What Is Iso In Photography • → What Is Shutter Speed • → What Is Depth Of Field • → What Is Manual Exposure In Photography • → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
