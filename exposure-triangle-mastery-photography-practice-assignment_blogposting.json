Students will learn to manipulate depth of field and motion capture while maintaining a fixed ISO for consistency.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, and ISO in the exposure triangle. * Develop skills in using Aperture and Shutter Priority modes for creative exposure control. * Learn how to assess and adjust exposure using histograms and metering modes.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Select a location with varying light conditions to practice exposure control. * Set your camera's ISO to a fixed value of 200 to ensure consistent sensitivity. * Familiarize yourself with your camera's metering modes and histogram display. * Decide whether you want to focus on depth of field or motion in your images. * Ensure your battery is charged and you have adequate storage spa camera's ISO to a fixed value of 200 to ensure consistent sensitivity. * Familiarize yourself with your camera's metering modes and histogram display. * Decide whether you want to focus on depth of field or motion in your images. * Ensure your battery is charged and you have adequate storage space on your memory card.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use Aperture Priority mode for controlling depth of field while allowing the camera to adjust shutter speed. * Utilize Shutter Priority mode to freeze motion and let the camera manage aperture settings. * Check your histogram frequently to avoid clipping highlights or shadows. * Experiment with different metering modes to see how they affect exposure. * Bracket your shots when light is tricky to ensure you capture the desired exposure.CREATIVE FOCUS * Explore shallow depth of field to isolate your subject from the background using a wide aperture. * Capture motion blur by using a slower shutter speed while maintaining a fixed ISO. * Use different angles and perspectives to enhance the effect of depth of field. * Incorporate foreground elements to add depth and interest to your compositions. * Experiment with backlighting to create dramatic silhouettes and contrast.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Shoot a portrait in Aperture Priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed for depth of field control. 2. Capture a moving subject, such as a person walking or running, in Shutter Priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera adjust the aperture. 3. Take a landscape photo in Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed to ensure proper exposure. 4. Photograph a busy street scene in Shutter Priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze motion, allowing the camera to adjust the aperture. 5. Experiment with low light conditions using Aperture Priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed and observe how the camera adapts the shutter speed. 6. Use Shutter Priority mode at 1/30s with ISO 200 fixed to creatively capture motion blur of moving water or traffic.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a series of images that demonstrate various depths of field effects using different aperture settings in Aperture Priority mode. * Challenge yourself to capture the same scene multiple times at different shutter speeds in Shutter Priority mode to compare motion effects.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do check your histogram after each shot to ensure proper exposure. * ✓ Do experiment with different metering modes to see how they affect your results. * ✓ Do take notes on the settings used for each shot to track your progress. * ✓ Do review your images critically to identify areas for improvement in exposure. * ✓ Do practice in various lighting conditions to understand how light affects exposure.DON'T * ✗ Don't shoot in fully manual mode; focus on using priority modes to master exposure. * ✗ Don't neglect to adjust your metering mode based on the scene's lighting. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of a fixed ISO; it helps maintain consistency. * ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose and assess your exposure. * ✗ Don't forget to engage with your histogram; it’s crucial for avoiding clipping.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did using Aperture Priority mode affect your control over depth of field? * What challenges did you face when capturing motion in Shutter Priority mode? * In wha ssess your exposure. * ✗ Don't forget to engage with your histogram; it’s crucial for avoiding clipping.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did using Aperture Priority mode affect your control over depth of field? * What challenges did you face when capturing motion in Shutter Priority mode? * In what ways did different metering modes influence your exposure results? * How can understanding the exposure triangle improve your overall photography skills?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Exposure In Photography * → What Is Iso In Photography * → What Is Shutter Speed * → What Is Depth Of Field * → What Is Manual Exposure In Photography * → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
