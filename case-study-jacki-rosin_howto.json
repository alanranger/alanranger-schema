Jackie has completed a mixture of practical workshops and classroom based tuition to improve her photo making and editing skills. Jacki has improved her ability to design photo compositions, execute the camera settings and put the final touches to images in Lightroom over the last 2 years.  Her journey has been a steady one but has shown a significant step up in the standard and quality of her work in the last 9 months.  Her work has featured most month's in the mentoring assignment blogs, showing she clearly works hard with each new challenge. I hope Jacki, won't mind me sharing this, and I know many people who are similar, but she doesn't always accept that her work is good enough as she has given herself a challenging level of quality to achieve, this, with her sometimes lack of confidence means that she has been pushed outside her comfort zone on a frequent basis with photography - but what better testament to the results can I make than her inspiring panel of images that she produced for the Intermediates Course and public exhibition of her work.Well done Jacki, always a pleasure to tutor and support your photography and I look forward to the next stage of your development.",

      "name": "Why did you want to become a photographer?I’d always had an interest, which I think comes from my Dad, but had only ever owned a compact camera. When I realised what you could achieve with a DSLR once it was out of the auto mode I was determined to learn how to use it to its full potential2.    Were you scared or anxious to start out?The answer to that has to be yes! Not so much in terms of learning and getting to grips with different technical ideas and managing my camera, but definitely when it came to showing my images and getting feedback from the rest of the group, which was really scary for the first few sessions.3.    Why did you select Alan as your tutor?I attended a 3 hour introductory session and was inspired by both Alan’s images and his method of teaching, which is both relaxed and informative",

I really didn't feel I had achieved anything. Alan’s course was totally different. The group was small and each one of us had personal attention therefore ensuring our individual  requirements were met, whatever stage of photography we were at.5.    What type of tuition have you had from Alan?5 Week Beginners CoursePost Processing Lightroom CourseSeveral location workshopsOn-line MentoringIntermediates Photography CourseMasterclasses6.    How do you feel Alan’s teaching style has helped develop your skills the most?Alan doesn't beat about the bush when it comes to giving feedback on your images! Having said that, all feedback is both honest and constructive and that is the only way to learn. That, combined with a relaxed (honest!) atmosphere makes for an enjoyable learning experience with plenty of banter flying about. The odd glass of wine thrown in helps too!",

The mentoring scheme often takes me out of my comfort zone when it comes to meeting Alan’s assignments, but this encourages me to try new ideas.9.    Could you describe how you felt when you were featured in the intermediates photography exhibition?A combination of utter terror and excitement of having my images on display in a public gallery. However the opening night was great and we all had positive comments from both friends and complete strangers.",
