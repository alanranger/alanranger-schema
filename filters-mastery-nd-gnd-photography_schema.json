You will learn how to manipulate exposure and colors effectively using these filters in various shooting conditions.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the different types of filters and their effects on exposure and color. * Learn to use ND filters for long exposure photography and to create motion blur. * Utilize GND filters to balance exposure between the sky and the foreground. * Employ Polarizer filters to reduce glare and enhance colors in landscape photography.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Select a suitable location that benefits from filter use, such as a landscape with contrasting elements. * Ensure you have a sturdy tripod to stabilize your camera for long exposures. * Familiarize yourself with your filter set and practice attaching them to your lens. * Set your camera to Aperture Priority or Sh location that benefits from filter use, such as a landscape with contrasting elements. * Ensure you have a sturdy tripod to stabilize your camera for long exposures. * Familiarize yourself with your filter set and practice attaching them to your lens. * Set your camera to Aperture Priority or Shutter Priority mode. * Fix your ISO to 200 to maintain consistent exposure across different lighting conditions.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use ND filters to achieve longer exposure times without overexposing your image. * Incorporate GND filters to control the brightness difference between the sky and ground. * Adjust your aperture for depth of field while letting the camera manage shutter speed. * Utilize Polarizer filters to increase color saturation and contrast in your images. * Experiment with various strengths of ND filters to see their impact on exposure.CREATIVE FOCUS * Capture flowing water in a river or waterfall using ND filters to create a silky effect. * Use GND filters during sunrise or sunset to prevent blown-out highlights. * Frame a scene where reflections in water can be enhanced using a Polarizer filter. * Experiment with landscape compositions that take advantage of enhanced colors from Polarizer filters. * Create abstract images by using long exposures with ND filters to blur moving subjects.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use ND filters to photograph a waterfall in Aperture Priority mode at f/11 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed for a smooth water effect. 2. Shoot a landscape during golden hour with a GND filter in Shutter Priority mode at 1/125s with ISO 200 fixed, letting the camera adjust aperture for balanced exposure. 3. Capture a vibrant sky with a Polarizer filter in Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, allowing the camera to set the shutter speed. 4. Photograph a busy street scene using ND filters to achieve motion blur while in Shutter Priority mode at 1/60s with ISO 200 fixed. 5. Use a GND filter to photograph a sunset over a lake in Aperture Priority mode at f/16 with ISO 200 fixed, letting your camera adjust the shutter speed to maintain depth of field. 6. Create a series of images that showcase the difference polarizing can make in colors and reflections, using Aperture Priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed.💡 Stretch Tasks * Combine the use of both ND and GND filters in a single shot during the daytime, ensuring proper exposure using Aperture Priority mode. * Create a time-lapse video of a sunset using ND filters to control exposure, while switching between different filter strengths.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do experiment with different filter strengths to see their effects on exposure. * ✓ Do practice setting your camera to the correct mode before shooting with filters. * ✓ Do use a tripod for stability, especially in low light situations. * ✓ Do take test shots to check for exposure and composition before finalizing your shot. * ✓ Do clean your filters before use to avoid unwanted spots or haze in your images.DON'T * ✗ Don't forget to check the histogram to ensure you are not overexposing your images. * ✗ Don't use filters in inappropriate lighting conditions that could lead to poor results. * ✗ Don't manually set all three exposure variables; use priority modes instead. * ✗ Don't neglect to consider the effect of filters on autofocus performance. * ✗ Don't rush your settings; take time to adjust and compose your sh n inappropriate lighting conditions that could lead to poor results. * ✗ Don't manually set all three exposure variables; use priority modes instead. * ✗ Don't neglect to consider the effect of filters on autofocus performance. * ✗ Don't rush your settings; take time to adjust and compose your shot correctly.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did using filters change your perception of light and color in your images? * What challenges did you face when using ND or GND filters, and how did you overcome them? * In what situations do you think you would most benefit from using a Polarizer filter? * How did the experience of using filters influence your creative process while shooting?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Do Camera Lens Filters Do * → Are Camera Uv Filters Worth It For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
