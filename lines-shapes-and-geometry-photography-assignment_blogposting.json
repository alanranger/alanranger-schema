The Assignment Technical Focus • Use aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed to achieve a wide depth of field. • Utilize shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed to capture moving elements against static lines. • Experiment with different angles to find the most effective lines that lead to your subject. • Pay attention to the framing of your shot; make sure leading lines don’t exit the frame. • Use a wide-angle lens to emphasize leading lines and shapes in your composition. Creative Focus • Look for natural curves in your environment, such as river bends or winding paths. • Incorporate man-made elements like fences or roads to create structure in your images. • Experiment with contrasting shapes and lines to create visual interest. • Try to include elements that break the lines or shapes to add dynamics to your composition. • Capture reflections in water or glass to enhance geometric shapes in your photos. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a pathway or road that leads into the distance, using aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed. • Find a building with strong geometric lines and capture it from a low angle, using shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed. • Explore a park and photograph different shapes created by trees, paths, or benches, utilizing aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. • Capture the curves of a river or road, ensuring the lines lead towards your subject, using shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed. • Identify and photograph a fence or wall with leading lines that guide the viewer to a focal point, using aperture priority mode at f/11 with ISO 200 fixed. • Take a photo of an intersection or crossroads where multiple lines converge, using shutter priority mode at 1/125s with ISO 200 fixed. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a series of images focusing on different types of leading lines (curved, straight, diagonal) and present them as a cohesive portfolio. • Challenge yourself to find and photograph a location using only geometric shapes, avoiding organic lines and curves. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do look for lines that naturally lead to your subject. • ✓ Do vary your perspective to discover unique leading lines. • ✓ Do ensure your composition is balanced when using strong geometric shapes. • ✓ Do experiment with both wide and tight framing to see how it affects the leading lines. • ✓ Do review your images post-shoot to analyze how effectively the lines guide the viewer's eye. DON'T • ✗ Don't let leading lines exit the frame, as this can distract from the subject. • ✗ Don't use cluttered backgrounds that may confuse the viewer’s eye. • ✗ Don't ignore the foreground; include elements that enhance the leading lines. • ✗ Don't shoot from eye level only; vary your height for more dynamic perspectives. • ✗ Don't forget to check your composition before pressing the shutter. Reflection Questions • How did the use of leading lines impact the viewer's eye movement in your images? • What challenges did you face when trying to incorporate shapes and geometry in your compositions? • In what ways did different perspectives change the effectiveness of leading lines? • How does the choice of aperture or shutter speed affect the depth and clarity of the leading lines in your photos? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Are Leading Lines In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
