I am excited to announce a new one-day workshop on the secrets to woodland photography. As most of you know, it’s probably my favourite place to photograph. Therefore this format of the workshop is long overdue. It will be different from other workshops in the format as it will be divided into separate sessions during the day to tackle theory, set-up, shooting, image review, and post-production. • A theory session, discussion on woodland photography and its challenges, and some answers, followed by practical advice on settings, lenses, equipment, etc. A presentation on developing creative vision and simplification in woodland settings A 2-hour woodland exploration and walk-making compositions and turning theory into practice in the field. Initial image reviews and critiques to shortlist images to edit Demonstration, advice and post-production of your woodland images I am running it from my home as I have easy and instant access to woodlands from my garden and a comfortable covered, heated outdoor space for viewing the presentation and your images on a large screen (if the weather permits) or indoors. Places are limited to four people, but I am happy to add dates if there is demand. More Details Summary DetailsThe Secrets to Woodland Photography - Coventry - 10 am - 4 pm, £125 Simplifying Woodland Photography: Unlocking the Secrets to Capturing the Beauty of Nature Discover the Art of Woodland Photography and Capture Nature's Beauty in a New Light Introduction Woodlands hold a mystical allure that often captivates our imagination. From small groves in local parks to vast forests stretching miles, these natural landscapes offer endless opportunities for photographers to create stunning images. However, many photographers find woodland photography challenging due to its chaotic, cluttered, and disorganised nature. In this one-day workshop, we will unravel the secrets of woodland photography, equipping you with the skills and techniques to capture the essence of these enchanting spaces. Understanding the Complexity of Woodland Photography Woodland photography presents unique challenges that require a thoughtful approach. The seemingly haphazard arrangement of tree trunks and crisscrossing branches can obstruct our attempts to create compelling compositions. However, with a deeper understanding of woodland ecosystems and an appreciation for the interplay of light and shadow, you can unlock the true potential of these captivating landscapes. Embracing the Chaotic Beauty of Woodlands Woodlands may appear disorganised at first glance, but they possess a natural rhythm and symmetry that can be harnessed to create visually striking compositions. By carefully observing the patterns and textures of the forest, you can reveal the hidden harmony within.
