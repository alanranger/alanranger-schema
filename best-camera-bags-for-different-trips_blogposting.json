  "articleBody": "this article, I aim to share insights on the three distinct bag sizes required for three different photographic scenarios, drawing from my personal experiences in the field. View fullsize Messenger Bag Small Backpack Larger Camera Backpacks • Messenger Bag: The Ideal Companion for Day Trips For day trips or outings, a messenger-style bag is the perfect companion. It offers quick and easy access to your camera, lenses, and essential accessories, all while you're on the move. With a capacity of ten to fifteen litres, it can comfortably hold all your necessities, from spare batteries to a water bottle, allowing you to focus on capturing the perfect shot without the hassle of setting the bag down. • Small Backpack: Versatile for One-Day Photography Excursions For one-day photography outings or workshops, a small backpack with a capacity between twelve and twenty litres is an excellent choice. These bags can accommodate a camera body, typically two lenses, filters, two spare batteries, a tripod, and a variety of smaller accessories while providing space for additional clothing layers and snacks. When you'll be out for extended periods ranging from three to eight hours, a comfortable backpack that can be worn while hiking or trekking up and down hills is essential. • Larger Backpack: Ideal for Multi-Day Photography Adventures For multi-day events or workshops, a giant backpack with a capacity between twenty and thirty litres becomes necessary. In addition to the gear required for one-day outings, such as a camera body, lenses, filters, chargers, and clothing layers, these backpacks offer ample space for additional lenses and accessories. Comfort and overall weight distribution are crucial considerations when selecting a larger backpack, as you'll likely be carrying it for extended periods while walking or trekking. In this article, I compare these three camera bags of different sizes and styles and share my verdict. Manfrotto and Lowepro kindly provided me with these bags to review, and whilst I haven’t tested them all in the field individually, I have sufficient experience to know how they feel when loaded, which I did, and how they would be utilised when using them. Features to consider when choosing a camera Bag Before we dive into the specifics of each camera bag, let's discuss the key features to consider when selecting the perfect photography companion: • Capacity and Compartments: The camera bag should have ample space to accommodate your camera body, lenses, and other essential accessories. Dedicated compartments and dividers help keep your gear organised and secure. Protection: Your camera equipment is an investment worth protecting. Look for camera bags with padded interiors, water-resistant materials, and robust construction to safeguard your gear from bumps, drops, and inclement weather. Comfort and Ergonomics: As a photographer, you'll often find yourself on the move, carrying your camera bag for extended periods. Padded shoulder straps, back panels, and adjustable hip belts can significantly improve comfort and distribute weight evenly. Accessibility: Quick access to your camera and lenses is essential for capturing fleeting moments. Look for backpacks with side or top openings, which allow you to retrieve your gear without having to remove the entire pack. Additional Features: Extras like tripod holders, rain covers, and laptop compartments can enhance the backpack's functionality and versatility. Introduction to messenger camera bags As a professional photographer, I understand the importance of having the right gear to capture stunning images. While cameras and lenses are essential tools, a reliable and functional camera bag is equally crucial. In this article, we will delve into the world of messenger camera bags, specifically comparing two popular options: the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III and the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II. Messenger camera bags have become a popular choice among photographers due to their versatility and convenience. These bags are designed to carry camera equipment while providing easy access, making them ideal for on-the-go shooting. With their sleek and stylish appearance, messenger bags blend seamlessly into urban environments, allowing photographers to move freely without drawing unnecessary attention. Comparison - Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III Versus Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II Key Features:Design: Messenger style. Tactical, rugged design with modular accessories.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Top access for quick camera retrieval, side and front pockets for additional storageMaterials: Durable. Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover built into base of bagAdditional Features: SlipLock compatible attachment loops for additional pouches and accessories plus small laptop spaceCapacity: 14LCamera Gear: DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lenses, and a flash.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. External side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £95Weight: 1.4kgDimensions:Internal: 37 x 14 x 25.5 cmExternal: 40 x 17 x 28 cmPros:* Highly durable and robust, suitable for demanding environments.* Excellent weather protection with AW Cover.* Modular design allows for customisation with additional pouches and accessories.Cons:* Heavier and bulkier than some other camera bags.* Tactical design may not be as versatile for all settings.My Verdict: 8/10It certainly meets my criteria for a short trip out with the camera, and with a couple of lenses and the little extras I need to stuff away somewhere outside of my clothing pockets. The front opening flap is a little annoying but does provide protection when the top of the bag is exposed to the elements. The flexible dividers in the bag are useful but slightly flimsy. But for me, the absence of quick access from the top to the camera inside the bag without opening the main bag flap is an irritant.More Information / Buy Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II Key Features:Design: Sleek, modern messenger bag design with a comfortable shoulder strap.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Quick access to top zipper and multiple external pockets for accessories.Materials: Durable.Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover - separate item (not built in) Additional Features: Dedicated padded compartment for a tablet or small laptop or other accessoriesCapacity: 16LCamera Gear: DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lenses, and a flash.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. External side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £79Weight: 1.09kgDimensions:Internal: 36 x 13 x 26 cmExternal: 39 x 19.5 x 28 cmPros:* Stylish and unobtrusive design suitable for everyday use.* Lightweight and easy to carry.* Good organisational features for smaller accessories.Cons:* Limited capacity compared to larger camera bags.* Might not fit larger professional camera bodies or lenses.My Verdict: 10/10Ticks lots of boxes for a day out with the camera and all your accessories and essential storage on your hip. Comfortable strapping and quick easy access with the top opening make it more practical for the travelling photographer or day-tripper. The inner divider sections are stiff making it easy to divide up the internal space to suit your gear. Even though both comparison bags are similar in dimensions, the Manfrotto Messenger bag feels naturally more roomy and easier.More Information / Buy Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III Comparison Summary: Capacity: Both bags offer similar capacities for camera gear, though the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III may accommodate slightly more personal items. Design: The Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III features a sleek, modern design ideal for everyday use, while the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II has a rugged, tactical look suitable for more demanding conditions. Protection: The Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II offers superior weather protection with its All Weather AW Cover, whereas the Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III focuses more on internal padding and water-repellent fabric. Access: Both bags provide quick access to camera gear, but the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II offers additional modularity and external storage options. Additional Features: The Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II's modular design and SlipLock system offer greater customisation for users needing to expand their carrying capacity. Overall, the choice between these two bags will depend on the user's specific needs: the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III is great for everyday use with a sleek design, while the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II is better suited for more rugged and customisable requirements. Introduction to Small Camera Backpacks As a passionate photographer, having the right gear is crucial for capturing those breathtaking moments. One essential piece of equipment that often gets overlooked is the camera backpack. It's not just a vessel for carrying your precious camera and lenses; it's a companion that ensures your equipment is protected, easily accessible, and comfortable during those long photography sessions. In this article, we'll explore two popular camera backpack options: the Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, Black, and the Manfrotto Street Camera Slim Backpack. We'll compare their features, pros, and cons, helping you determine which one best suits your photography needs and lifestyle. Comparison - Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, Black versus Manfrotto Street camera Slim Backpack Key Features:Design: Lightweight and versatile backpack.Protection: All Weather AW Cover for protection against the elements.Access: Rear and side access to gear, multiple compartments.Materials: Durable, eco-friendly fabric made from recycled materials.Additional Features: CradleFit compartment for a 15-inch laptop or tablet, adjustable dividers.Capacity: 18.5LCamera Gear: Mirrorless camera with attached small lens and accessories.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. Some clothing and external side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £99Weight: 0.9kgDimensions:Internal: 26 x 11 x 44 cmExternal: 26 x 15 x 45 cmPros: * Excellent protection with the All Weather AW Cover, ensuring gear is safe in various weather conditions. * Made from durable, eco-friendly fabric produced from recycled materials.* Comfortable padding on straps for shoulders and your backCons:* Bulkier Design: Slightly bulkier compared to slim profile backpacks, which may not be ideal for all settings.* The camera compartment is very small and only suited to the mirrorless camera body with one small lens attached* Lacks configurable dividers for camera section in the bagMy Verdict:6/10Despite having a larger overall capacity over the similar external dimensions of the Manfrotto I couldn't configure it satisfactorily to accommodate the same amount of camera gear, accessories and clothing items as quickly as the Manfrotto Street Slimpack. I do like the ability to take the camera cube out from the bag and use as a shoulder bag independantly but feel it suits much smaller camera bodies and smaller lenses than my own requirements. The padding and comfort is better than the Manfrotto equivalent.More Information / Buy Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, Black Key Features:Design: Slim, stylish, and compact, making it ideal for urban environments and lighter loads.Protection: Padded compartments for camera gear.Access: Front and top access to gear, quick-access pockets.Materials: Durable, water-repellent fabric.Additional Features: Dedicated compartment for a 14-inch laptop, adjustable dividersCapacity: 15LCamera Gear: Mirrorless or compact DSLR camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lensesPersonal Items: Space for small personal items. Some clothing and external side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £90Weight: 0.8kgDimensions:Internal: 25 x 19.5 x 10.5 cmExternal: 29 x 18 x 43 cmPros: * Front and top access with quick-access pockets for ease of use * Customizable interior with adjustable dividers for better organisation.* Slim, stylish, and compact, making it ideal for urban environments and lighter loads.Cons:* While it offers padded compartments and water-repellent fabric, it does not provide the same level of weather protection as the Lowepro* While durable, it lacks the eco-friendly materials featured in the Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW* The shoulder straps would benefit from more padding for comfortMy Verdict:9/10I like this small bag because it can accommodate a small but adequate amount of camera gear for the one-day workshop outing, including a good-sized top section for those vital additional layers of clothing, snacks and accessories. It also has two side pockets to fit water bottles or flasks. The camera section is easily configurable for different combinations of camera body and one or two lenses. It's overall design is commendable.More Information / Buy Manfrotto Street camera Slim Backpack Protection and Durability: The Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW offers superior weather protection with its All Weather AW Cover and eco-friendly recycled materials, while the Manfrotto Street Camera Slim Backpack features padded compartments and water-repellent fabric but lacks comprehensive weather protection. Design and Weight: The Manfrotto Street Camera Slim Backpack is slim, stylish, and lightweight, ideal for urban environments and lighter loads. The Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW is bulkier and heavier, designed for more extensive use with better storage for non-camera items. Cost and Capacity: The Lowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, priced around £90 provides a larger capacity suitable for mirrorless cameras and includes a 15-inch laptop compartment. In contrast, the Manfrotto Street Camera Slim Backpack, at approximately $£90, offers a smaller overall capacity for mirrorless or compact DSLR setups and a 14-inch laptop compartment, making it a more affordable and despite its size I found it easier to get the gear I needed into. Introduction to Larger Camera Backpacks As a fellow landscape enthusiast, I've spent countless hours trekking through the wilderness with my gear strapped to my back. Today, we're diving deep into two popular choices for outdoor photographers: the WANDRD PRVKE 31L and the Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II. Let's see how these packs measure up when protecting your precious cargo while you chase that perfect golden hour shot. The WANDRD PRVKE 31L and the Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II are exceptional choices for landscape and outdoor photographers. They're both durable, comfortable, and designed for adventurous shooters. Comparison - WANDRD PRVKE 31L versus Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II Key Features:Design: Stylish, minimalist, and highly functional urban design.Protection: Camera cube with padded and configurable dividersAccess: Side, top, and back panel access with a roll-top closure for expandable storage.Materials: Waterproof Tarpaulin, Robic 1680D Ballistic Nylon, Weather Resistant Zippers.Additional Features: Removable camera cube, expandable roll top, padded laptop/tablet sleeve, hidden passport pocket, and luggage pass-through.Capacity: 31L to 36L with Roll-topCamera Gear: Can hold a DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 4-5 additional lenses, a drone, and accessories.Personal Items: Ample space for personal items, expandable roll top adds extra storage capacity.Cost: Approximately £320 with Pro Photo BundleWeight: 1.5kgDimensions:Internal: 46 X 29 X 17 CMExternal: 53 X 30 X 18 CMPros: * Stylish, urban design with expandable roll-top.* Waterproof materials and multiple access points.* Lightweight and versatile for both camera gear and personal items.* Clamshell OpeningCons:* Cost - It is expensive but worth it if you can stretch your budget for the extra quality and versatility it provides* Camera equipment space in the cube is limited to one camera body and 2-3 lenses.My Verdict:10/10The Wandrd PRVKE comes in three sizes—21L, 31L, and 41L—each with configurable options for a photography cube to house your camera equipment. The expandable roll-top is a key feature allowing you to adapt the bag for different situations and what you need to include inside the bag for the outing. The internal organisation options are great giving you easy access from front, back, side and top access to anything you need to reach. Highly recommendedMore Information / Buy WANDRD PRVKE Key Features:Design: Tactical, rugged, and highly customisable.Protection: Tactical, rugged, and highly customisable with SlipLock loops.Access: Side, top, and back panel access with a roll-top closure for expandable storage.Materials: Durable and weather-resistant materials with reinforced structure of Ballistic NylonAdditional Features: All Weather AW Cover, ActivZone harness for comfort, SlipLock compatible loops for additional pouches, and modular interior dividersCapacity: 25LCamera Gear: Can hold 1-2 Pro DSLRs, one with a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens attached, 6-8 additional lenses or speedlights, and accessories.Personal Items: Ample space for personal items, expandable roll top adds extra storage capacity.Cost: Approximately £260Weight: 2.5kgDimensions:Internal: 30 x 16 x 44 cmExternal: 36 x 22 x 52 cmPros: * High capacity for professional camera gear.* Highly customisable with SlipLock compatible loops.* Good protection with all weather covers.* Clamshell OpeningCons:* Heavier and bulkier.* Less space for personal itemsMy Verdict: 9/10The Lowepro Pro Tactic BP 450 is a great bag with plenty of space for camera equipment. If you are carrying lots of gear safely in very rugged and damage-resistant padding, this is the bag for you. The space for camera body(s),lenses, filters, and other equipment is unequalled. My only caveat with this backpack is where I put my packed lunch and a few clothing accessories. Basically, it's all camera equipment and not much else. I love it for the ruggedness and protection it provides for expensive gear, but I really want some space to pack non-camera equipment, too. More Information / Buy Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II Design and Accessibility: WANDRD PRVKE 31L is stylish and versatile. It has a roll-top design, offers multiple access points (side, top, back), and is made from waterproof materials, making it ideal for urban environments.

With four access points and modular customisation via SlipLock loops, it's perfect for those who need extensive gear organisation. Capacity and Weight: WANDRD PRVKE 31L: This lightweight bag accommodates a DSLR/mirrorless camera with 4-5 lenses. Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II: This bag holds 1-2 Pro DSLRs with up to 8 lenses/speed lights but it is heavier. Protection and Cost: WANDRD PRVKE 31L offers good weather resistance and waterproof materials, Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II: This product provides protection with an All-Weather AW Cover and durable structure but doesn’t match the Wandrd for external weather protection.
