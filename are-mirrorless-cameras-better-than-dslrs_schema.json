In contrast, mirrorless cameras employ a combination of phase detection and contrast detection autofocus directly on the sensor. This hybrid approach allows for more precise focusing, especially when using wide apertures, highlighting a key difference between DSLR and mirrorless.Mirrorless cameras also benefit from having phase detection autofocus points spread across a larger area of the sensor, providing better coverage and improved subject-tracking capabilities. Some high-end mirrorless cameras, such as the Sony A7R V, feature advanced autofocus systems with a high number of phase detection points for exceptional performance.EYE DETECTION AND FACE DETECTIONOne of the standout features of mirrorless cameras is their advanced eye-detection and face-detection capabilities. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, mirrorless cameras can accurately detect and track human and animal eyes, ensuring sharp focus even when the subject is moving.This technology is beneficial for portrait, wedding, and pet photography, where maintaining focus on the subject's eyes is crucial. Many mirrorless cameras, including the Sony A7 IV, offer reliable eye and face detection that can significantly improve the accuracy and consistency of focus.LOW LIGHT FOCUSINGMirrorless cameras generally outperform DSLRs when it comes to low-light focusing. The sensor-based autofocus systems in mirrorless cameras can detect contrast and focus accurately, even in dimly lit situations.Additionally, the electronic viewfinder in mirrorless cameras can boost the brightness of the scene, making it easier to compose and focus in low-light conditions. This is a significant advantage over the optical viewfinder found in DSLRs, which can be challenging to use in low light, further emphasizing the difference between mirrorless and DSLR cameras.Autofocus FeatureMirrorless CamerasDSLRsAF SystemHybrid (Phase Detection + Contrast Detection)Separate Phase Detection ModuleAF Point CoverageWide, across the sensorLimited, clustered in the centreEye Detection & Face DetectionAdvanced, AI-poweredLimited or not availableLow Light FocusingExcellent, thanks to sensor-based AF and electronic viewfinderStruggles due to separate AF module and optical viewfinderIn summary, mirrorless cameras have a clear edge when it comes to autofocus capabilities. With their hybrid autofocus systems, advanced eye detection and face detection, and superior low light focusing, mirrorless cameras offer photographers a more reliable and efficient focusing experience compared to traditional DSLRs, making them a compelling choice in the mirrorless dslr debate.SIZE, WEIGHT AND ERGONOMICS: MIRRORLESS VS MIRROR CAMERAWhen it comes to camera size and weight in the mirrorless vs mirror camera comparison, mirrorless cameras generally have an advantage over DSLRs. The absence of a mirror mechanism allows for a more compact camera body design.
