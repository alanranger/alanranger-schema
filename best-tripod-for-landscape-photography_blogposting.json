A good set of legs and a reliable head can make the difference between sharp, confident images and a frustrating session of soft or slightly misaligned frames. I am often asked by clients what I recommend as the best tripod for landscape photography. I’ve written before about my experiences comparing different support systems in my Gitzo vs Benro tripod review. This time, Benro asked me to test a newer combination for landscape work: • Benro Mammoth TMTH44C carbon-fibre tripod Benro GD36PT hybrid geared head I’ve been using them alongside my long-term Benro setup: Benro GD3WH Precision Geared Head Benro Combination C3770TN Series 3 Carbon tripod As landscape photographers, we’re all looking for reliable tripods for photography, and this combination is a strong contender, especially for stability, low shooting positions, and precise composition. This review focuses on how the Mammoth + GD36PT perform in real landscape conditions, and whether they genuinely belong in the conversation for the best tripods for landscape photography – especially if you already own older Benro legs or the GD3WH. If you’re just starting your tripod research, see my guide on the best lightweight travel tripods View fullsize 1. What I look for in a landscape tripod For the kind of landscape work I do – seascapes, woodland, long exposures and changeable light – my tripod needs to: Stay rock solid in wind and on uneven ground Reach a comfortable eye-level height without a centre column Go very low for foreground-driven compositions Handle heavier lenses with a good safety margin Allow precise composition without constant fiddling I’ll use that lens to compare the heads and legs. Tripod Head Comparison – Benro GD36PT vs GD3WH How the newer hybrid geared head compares to my long-term GD3WH for landscape photography. Feature / Spec Benro GD36PT Benro GD3WH Head type Hybrid ball + geared head Pure 3-way geared head Geared control Pitch & roll geared; panning free-moving Full geared control on all 3 axes Movement range Small geared range; larger moves via ball Wide geared range on each axis Load capacity Approx. 6 kg Weight ≈ 690 g ≈ 870 g Quick release Arca clamp with supplied spacer Arca clamp Typical UK price £279–£329 £165–£195 Video references YouTube: GD36PT overview & demo YouTube: Benro geared head in use What “hybrid geared” actually means The GD36PT is described as a hybrid ball + geared head. In practice that means: You use the ball to make big moves quickly – for example, swinging from portrait to landscape or re-aiming to a new composition. Once you’re close, you use the geared knobs on pitch and roll to nudge the framing by small, precise increments. So you get some of the speed of a ball head with much of the precision of a geared head, which is very appealing for landscape photography where horizons and fine adjustments matter. The trade-off is that not every axis is geared. Panning (yaw) is still a free-moving, non-geared rotation at the base, whereas on the GD3WH every axis is driven by a geared knob. Coming from the older head, I often found my hand reaching for a geared control that simply isn’t there. My experience with the GD36PT in the field I really enjoyed the feel of the geared movement on the GD36PT. It’s smooth, positive and very satisfying when you’re levelling the horizon or lining up foreground elements precisely. However, there are two important limitations to be aware of: Limited geared pitch range You only get a relatively small amount of geared travel forwards and backwards (pitch). To go beyond that, you have to loosen the ball and re-set the head, then come back to the gears for fine tuning. That’s workable, but slower than a full-range geared head when you’re making bigger compositional changes. Snagging on the tripod mounting plate The more serious issue for me is mechanical rather than conceptual. When I pitch the camera further forwards or backwards, the geared controls and housing can physically snag on the top mounting plate of the Mammoth tripod. The supplied spacer under the head just isn’t quite high enough – it feels like it’s short by about 3 mm – so there isn’t enough clearance between the outer body of the head and the tripod plate. In normal, near-level shooting positions the head is a pleasure to use. It’s when you push into steeper pitches – which happens often in landscape photography when you’re shooting up a slope or down to foreground rocks – that the snag becomes frustrating. By contrast, the GD3WH doesn’t suffer from this. It’s slower to work with overall, but the full geared range and extra physical clearance mean it feels more predictable when you’re working at the extremes. 3. Tripod legs comparison – Mammoth TMTH44C vs C3770TN Tripod Legs – Benro Mammoth TMTH44C vs C3770TN Comparing my long-term Benro legs with the heavier-duty Mammoth for landscape photography. Benro Mammoth TMTH44C Benro Combination C3770TN Material Carbon fibre Leg sections 4-section 3-section Max height (no column) ≈ 160 cm ≈ 159 cm Min height ≈ 14 cm (very low) ≈ 38 cm Payload rating Up to 25 kg Up to 18 kg ≈ 2.25 kg ≈ 2.03 kg Levelling / top plate 75 mm bowl levelling platform Flat platform Feet Rubber + spiked feet supplied Rubber feet (spikes optional) Accessory mounts Three 3/8\" accessory threads on apex None £329–£379 £225–£275 My experience with the Mammoth TMTH44C I really enjoyed using the Mammoth tripod legs. Out on the coastline, with incoming waves and gusty wind, the whole setup felt solid and reliable. The thicker carbon legs and wide stance inspire confidence; once it’s planted, the tripod doesn’t feel nervous or twitchy. Although it is slightly heavier than my usual C3770TN setup, I was happy with that trade-off for the comfort and stability it gave me. For the way I typically work – often not too far from the car, but on uneven ground – the extra weight felt like a fair price for the way the tripod behaved. The very low minimum height is a real asset. Being able to get the camera down around 14 cm off the ground opens up foreground-driven compositions that simply aren’t possible on taller-minimum systems. The 75 mm bowl also makes levelling for panoramas or precise horizons much quicker. Instead of fighting individual leg lengths, you can get the base level and then fine-tune with the head. 4. Combined setup comparison – old vs new Benro kit Complete Setup – Old vs New Benro Landscape Tripods How my long-term GD3WH + C3770TN kit compares to the new Mammoth + GD36PT as a complete tripod for landscape photography. Category Old SetupGD3WH + C3770TN New SetupMammoth TMTH44C + GD36PT Total weight (legs + head) ≈ 2.9 kg ≈ 2.94 kg Max working height Minimum shooting height ≈ 14 cm (much lower) Stability / payload margin Very good (18 kg legs) Excellent (25 kg legs) Head behaviour Full 3-axis geared control, predictable at extremes Hybrid: fast ball + partial gearing, but limited pitch and clearance issues Levelling workflow Leg adjustments only 75 mm bowl for quick base levelling Approx. combined cost (UK) ≈ £390–£470 ≈ £609–£700 Best suited to Budget-conscious, precise composition, lighter loads Demanding landscapes, heavier lenses, low-angle work 5. Verdict – is the Mammoth + GD36PT the best tripod for landscape photography? Putting it all together: As a set of legs, the Benro Mammoth TMTH44C is outstanding. For landscape photography it ticks almost every box: stability, height, very low shooting positions, and a bowl that makes levelling fast. I’d happily call it one of the best tripods for landscape photography in its class, especially for serious users who aren’t counting every gram. As a head, the Benro GD36PT is a more nuanced story. The hybrid concept works well and the geared motion is lovely to use within its range, but the limited pitch movement and the snagging on the tripod mounting plate mean it doesn’t fully replace my GD3WH for more extreme compositions. If you’re building or upgrading a serious tripod for landscape photography, my honest conclusion would be: ✅ Mammoth TMTH44C – highly recommended ⚖️ GD36PT – good within limits, but I’d like a taller spacer and more geared range 💡 GD3WH – still excellent when you need full-range geared control 🛒 Where to Buy Benro UK – GD36PT 3-Way Geared Head: → https://uk.benroeu.com/benro-gd36pt-3-way-geared-head/ Benro UK – Mammoth TMTH44C Carbon Fibre Tripod: → https://uk.benroeu.com/mammoth-tmth44c-carbon-fibre-tripod/ Amazon – Mammoth TMTH44C Carbon Fibre Tripod: → https://amzn.to/43vQ4ox WEX – GD36PT 3-Way Geared Head: → https://wex.pxf.io/dOm04j WEX – Mammoth TMTH44C Carbon Fibre Tripod: → https://wex.pxf.io/qz73rY Some links on this page may be affiliate links, meaning I may earn a small commission at no cost to you. 6.

A: Not always, but generally a heavier or more robust tripod offers better stability in wind, on rocks and uneven ground. The Benro Mammoth is slightly heavier than my older setup, but the extra stability and low shooting height make a noticeable difference in the field. Q: Is a geared head worth it for landscape photography? A: Yes. A geared head allows for precise adjustments to horizon and composition without the “spring-back” of a ball head. The GD36PT is excellent for fine adjustments, but if you frequently shoot at extreme angles, the GD3WH’s full-range gearing may suit you better. recommended-productsAlan Ranger14 November 2025tripod LinkedIn0 Pinterest0",
