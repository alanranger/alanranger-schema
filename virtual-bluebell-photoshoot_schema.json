I appreciate your concern and fear not, normal service of daily or bi-daily posts will resume soon enough. I know you have missed me filling up your inboxes for the last several days but I have been working on a mini-project. When I say “mini-project” that’s how it started off and like most projects it wasn’t long before scope creep became a major factor and took me out of my comfort zone of still photography, Lightroom and Photoshop into a new product for me, Adobe Premiere Pro. Software designed to blend and produce a video from multiple media assets.A steep learning curve over 72 hrs but with the help of Con McHugh and various YouTube tutorials I have managed to cobble, and hopefully “craft”, something together that ultimately brings the bluebell woodlands to you this spring. Today *Friday 24th April) was the first day of my scheduled bluebell woodland workshops (i’m glad I got the timing right again), it’s such a pity that I can’t run these as planned and enable you to marvel at the spectacle of the amazing sight of a woodland covered in a dense carpet of these blue annual shows-offs. I went there on Tuesday (21st Apr) at sunrise to record the NHS worker/singers in the woods and took a few images early morni pity that I can’t run these as planned and enable you to marvel at the spectacle of the amazing sight of a woodland covered in a dense carpet of these blue annual shows-offs. I went there on Tuesday (21st Apr) at sunrise to record the NHS worker/singers in the woods and took a few images early morning before they arrived. I don’t mind admitting that the sight of watching them sing in the bluebell woodlands brought tears to my eyes. I hope this video does that emotion some justice.VIRTUAL BLUEBELL PHOTOSHOOT WOODLANDS 2020 WITH AN NHS JUNIOR DOCTORThis video has been produced bring the bluebell woodlands you as I know many of you can’t go to them, let alone photograph and enjoy them. We hope that instead of you being able to visit you can make a donation to SWFT Charity - South Warwickshire NHS > SWFT Charity funds enhancements beyond the NHS standard for Warwick, Leamington Spa, Stratford and Ellen Badger Hospital as well as out of hospital community services across the whole of Warwickshire.
