It searches for used camera gear from MPB, Wex, Park Cameras, FFordes, Mifsuds and many more. I can’t vouch for the site or the search results but thought on the face of it, it might be a useful resource for my clients and readers. https://usedlens.co.uk?ul=alanranger Used Lens Usedlens.co.uk is a free to use service, a tool which will save you time searching the internet for used / second hand cameras and lenses. They do not sell used camera gear, only promote those who do. Every day they check retailers, such as MPB, Ebay, Park Cameras, Wex and Amazon and many more, to keep our service up to date and show the latest used cameras and lenses. The site is constantly evolving and they appreciate all the input from the photographer community in helping this site grow.
