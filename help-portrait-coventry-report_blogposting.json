Help Portrait is a global movement of photographers, hairstylists and makeup artists using their time, tools and expertise to give back to those in need.Help Portrait is about GIVING the pictures, not taking them. These portraits aren’t for a portfolio, website, or sale. It’s about giving people who otherwise couldn’t afford photography, a chance to capture a moment, a memory…and a whole lot more.Photography has always been something that is an expression of individual perspective, values and interpretation for me. Images that don't convey a narrative or have a reason for personal connection simply don't resonate or hold my attention. I wanted to connect what I do for a living, in the community I live in with people I encounter and feel compassion for. The idea was simple if I cannot go and photograph refugees or victims of famine, war and other injustices then I should at least start at home and use my skills to raise awareness, inform and give photography back to those who could not afford it. In the process, I aimed to give people, volunteers and recipients, some dignity, respect and sense of how a photograph can make a difference on many levels.I proposed the idea to my Facebook Client Group (Alan Ranger Photography) and was delighted that aphy back to those who could not afford it. In the process, I aimed to give people, volunteers and recipients, some dignity, respect and sense of how a photograph can make a difference on many levels.I proposed the idea to my Facebook Client Group (Alan Ranger Photography) and was delighted that there were a number of people who wanted to support the idea.What followed over the next six-nine months were many meetings and sometimes resistance to my insistence to plan methodically and set the bar high on execution. I'm pleased to say that despite my initial fears about who, how, when, why were largely academic. However, I am also confident in saying that the team, collectively, through my nagging and pushing did rise to the challenges I set and have produced the most wonderful outcome for the people we aimed to reach and support.https://xposure.ae/XpsoureThrough my association with Xposure International Photography Festival, we managed to secure sponsorship that meant equipment and consumables were financed. Their support financially and ethically is so appreciated and we cannot thank them enough for everything they have provided that has ensured that a great idea didn't get beached due to financial resources to provide what we needed.----------------------------------------WHO TO SUPPORT?After the initial idea was hatched about photographers and others providing their skills, expertise and time to provide people in need with a special day, we had the task of identifying a group of people.Having previously worked with Crisis Skylight in Coventry on Christmas Day to provide homeless people a special day, it occurred to me that whilst my time on the day was helpful, my skills and experience were not really utilised by serving cups of squash and dinners. Don't get me wrong, I was and am happy to do whatever is needed to provide vulnerable people with what is needed. However, I felt that more could be done and I could be put to even better use.So Crisis Skylight in Coventry became our target group of people to provide a professional portrait print and whatever other services we could combine to make it a special day.CRISIS SKYLIGHT COVENTRYCrisisCrisis Skylight Coventry and Warwickshire is an outreach service that works with homeless individuals and those at risk of homelessness.Based in the city centre, they deliver their services throughout Coventry in various venues including those provided by partners. Crisis Skylight come into contact with over 600 people a year in Coventry.Homelessness in all its guises is sad. Not everyone is a rough sleeper and many people find themselves with no fixed abode for many reasons:INDIVIDUAL REASONS: * Leaving an institution * Relationship breakdown * Substance misuse * Physical or mental health problems * Escaping a violent/abusive relationshipSTRUCTURAL REASONS: * Welfare reform and benefit cuts * A low pay weakened job market * Reduced access to affordable housing marketPHOTOGRAPHS - DOCUMENT, INFORM, EDUCATE AND EXPRESSIt makes me really sad that anyone in this century ends up with such insecurity, judgement and resulting low self-esteem due to circumstances, government policy and the lack of support.My view may be simplistic, we are born equal as human beings and deserve to be given opportunities and most importantly self-respect whatever our personal circumstances and upbringing, but clearly today's society has become polarised between circumstances, government policy and the lack of support.My view may be simplistic, we are born equal as human beings and deserve to be given opportunities and most importantly self-respect whatever our personal circumstances and upbringing, but clearly today's society has become polarised between the haves and have-nots.Help PortraitBe it mental health, relationship issues/consequences, education, welfare state cuts and access to the support that each individual needs to make a better life, we all live in the same community, share the same streets, shops and services but most importantly all want an improved standard of living and life. I feel that it benefits society as a whole if everyone in it feels they are part of it and is contributing in any way they can and gets the support they need to progress themselves and their communities further.My thoughts were idealistic maybe but also heartfelt and I know those that supported the event shared the same feelings of outrage, compassion and wanting to do something that gave vulnerable people who had fallen on bad times some hope dignity and self-worth again through the power of a photograph.Quote from Crisis Team on the eventHELP-PORTRAIT WAS ONE OF OUR HIGHEST ATTENDED ACTIVITIES IN THE 4 AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN COVENTRY & WARWICKSHIRE.
