Creative Focus • Look for candid moments that reveal emotions and relationships between subjects. • Use color and contrast to enhance the emotional tone of your photographs. • Experiment with negative space to emphasize your subject and the story it tells. • Capture gestures and body language that convey interaction and connection. • Try to tell a story in a single frame by focusing on a decisive moment. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a series of portraits that express different emotions, using aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed. • Create a photo essay that follows a day in the life of a local community member, using shutter priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed. • Capture a moment of interaction between two people, focusing on their gestures and expressions while in aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. • Shoot an environmental portrait that tells a story about the subject's life through the use of props and background elements, using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed. • Document an event or gathering, capturing candid moments that convey the atmosphere, using shutter priority mode at 1/125s with ISO 200 fixed. • Create a series of images that depict a specific theme or concept, ensuring each photo contributes to the overall narrative, using aperture priority mode at f/3.5 with ISO 200 fixed. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Develop a multimedia storytelling project that incorporates both photography and audio or written elements. • Create a photo series that captures a narrative arc, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

DON'T • ✗ Don't rely solely on posed shots; seek out genuine, candid moments. • ✗ Don't ignore the impact of lighting; use it consciously to enhance the mood. • ✗ Don't overcomplicate your composition; keep it focused on the story. • ✗ Don't shoot without a clear intention or theme in mind. • ✗ Don't forget to experiment with different angles and perspectives to find the best storytelling shot. Reflection Questions • How did your choice of composition influence the narrative you were trying to convey? • What emotions did you aim to capture, and how successful were you in doing so? • In what ways did lighting affect the mood of your photographs? • What challenges did you face in telling a story through your images, and how did you overcome them? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → The Art Of Storytelling Photography • → How To Find Your Photography Style For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
