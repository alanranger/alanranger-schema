Understandably, he was frustrated with the process — and the feedback — so he reached out for some honest mentoring and a fresh set of eyes on his failed panel before making one last, all-or-nothing attempt.It didn’t take long to spot the culprits. Many of the images were over-processed, showing halos, noise, and other tell-tale signs that would make any assessor twitch. Technically, that meant the panel was never going to pass — but the raw material was there. John’s visual awareness and range of genres were solid; the problem was more about cohesion. As a set, the images weren’t quite singing from the same hymn sheet.Over three intensive one-hour Zoom sessions, we pulled the whole thing apart and rebuilt it. Re-edits, replacements, and a fair bit of straight-talking later, John emerged with a brand-new panel — this time balanced, polished, and technically tight from corner to corner.The result? Success! John passed his LRPS distinction and gained a deeper understanding of the editing workflow that will no doubt strengthen his already impressive list of photographic accolades.Well done, John — a great result, and a reminder that sometimes less clarity really does bring more clarity. 😉!--- ccess!

I heard of his reputation by word of mouth and then researched his website and read other people’s reviews.Describe how you found the RPS Mentoring Classes> The format Alan used was very easy to understand and follow. Each session lasted an hour and was very constructive.> The pace was adapted to my level as required. Alan was very patient and answered every question on each aspect of the LRPS criteria.> We carefully worked through my panel in detail together so that some images were replaced and others were altered.> Alan was always at the end of the phone when needed.Did you feel you got the right level of support from the sessions?> Yes, definitely.Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction before starting the mentoring course?> I felt I was good enough to gain the LRPS but had failed on two previous occasions.> It seemed to me that I had not got the right level of post-processing and presentation skills for this award.> Alan advised me to go back to the raw files and re-process them, as my previous panels had been over-processed.> He also recommended re-arranging the images in my panel and changing several.> Going forward, I continue to use Alan’s workflow advice, which I’m enjoying. My images are a lot better for these changes.What distinction did you apply for, and were you successful?> I applied for the LRPS — and yes, I was successful.What was your experience like on the RPS Assessment Day?> I had two RPS assessment days. I didn’t find either very helpful and failed after both, despite following their advice to the letter.> I would not recommend these to anyone. Both sessions lacked detail and depth and were far too superficial.Did you seek independent advice, feedback or input elsewhere before your panel assessment?> I had two sessions with the RPS assessors and failed.> I had three sessions with Alan — and passed.Having completed the course and distinction assessment, what advice would you share with others?> Before starting your journey, submit several images to Alan.> He’ll advise whether they’re good enough, how to approach post-processing, and how to design your panel layout.What was the hardest part of gaining a distinction with the RPS — and why?> The hardest part was trying to unpack what was actually required from the detailed criteria.> It was difficult to understand how some successful panels had met all of them.> I had many award-winning images from other photographic organisations that the RPS assessors were highly critical of — which added to my confusion.Has working towards a distinction helped you progress as a photographer?> Yes, but only because of Alan’s input.> The feedback ad met all of them.> I had many award-winning images from other photographic organisations that the RPS assessors were highly critical of — which added to my confusion.Has working towards a distinction helped you progress as a photographer?> Yes, but only because of Alan’s input.> The feedback from the RPS after each failed assessment was inconsistent and contradictory — which only increased my confusion.Any other comments you’d like to add?> I cannot recommend Alan highly enough — his patience and knowledge are exceptional.> I’m looking forward to working with him again when I consider the ARPS.> Thank you, Alan. I’m very grateful and thrilled to have finally succeeded — I would not have tried again without your guidance.John SimpsonEFIAP, CPAGB, BPE4, LRPS----------------------------------------Click on images to see full screenView fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize View fullsize ----------------------------------------If you are interested in attaining an RPS distinction I can support you with my RPS Courses for distinctions RPS Mentoring Course SUMMARY- PRODUCE A PANEL OF IMAGES FOR AN RPS DISTINCTIONS QUALIFICATION * ZOOM - ONLINE * EVENING CLASS - 19:00 - 21:00.
