The Assignment Technical Focus • Utilize a shallow depth of field (f/2.8, 1/125s, ISO 200) in aperture priority mode to isolate flowers during spring. • Set your camera to manual mode with a shutter speed of 1/500s, aperture f/11, and ISO 100 to capture the vibrant colors of summer landscapes. • Use a polarizing filter to enhance autumn foliage colors while shooting at f/4, 1/250s, ISO 400. • In winter, experiment with long exposures (f/8, 15s, ISO 100) to create dreamy effects in snowy scenes. • Adjust white balance settings to 'Cloudy' to warm up the tones in your autumn photographs. Creative Focus • Capture the interplay of light and shadow during the golden hour to enhance the mood of your seasonal images. • Incorporate leading lines in your compositions to draw the viewer's eye through the scene. • Experiment with reflections in water during autumn to add depth and interest to your shots. • Create a series of images that showcase the transition between seasons, focusing on changes in color and texture. • Utilize negative space in winter photography to emphasize the stark beauty of a snow-covered landscape. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a blooming flower in spring at f/2.8, 1/125s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode to capture its delicate details. • Capture a vibrant summer sunset at f/8, 1/60s, ISO 100 using manual mode to highlight the colors of the sky. • Shoot a forest scene in autumn at f/5.6, 1/250s, ISO 400 in aperture priority mode, focusing on the colorful leaves. • Document a winter landscape at f/11, 1/500s, ISO 100 using manual mode to capture sharp details across the scene. • Create a macro shot of frost on a leaf in winter at f/4, 1/60s, ISO 400 in manual mode to highlight intricate textures. • Photograph a spring meadow at f/8, 1/125s, ISO 200 in aperture priority mode to capture the vibrancy of new life. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a time-lapse series documenting the transition from winter to spring, capturing the gradual change in landscape over weeks. • Develop a photo essay that tells the story of a specific location through all four seasons, focusing on the changes in flora and fauna. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do scout locations in advance to find the best compositions for each season. • ✓ Do experiment with different perspectives and angles to create unique images. • ✓ Do utilize natural light to enhance the mood of your photographs. • ✓ Do take notes on camera settings and conditions for future reference. • ✓ Do practice patience and wait for the right moment to capture seasonal changes. DON'T • ✗ Don't rely solely on auto mode; learn to use manual or priority modes for better control. • ✗ Don't forget to check your histogram to ensure proper exposure. • ✗ Don't ignore the weather; clouds can create dramatic effects but also require adjustments in settings. • ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose and consider your framing. • ✗ Don't overlook the smaller details; often, the beauty of a season lies in its subtleties.
