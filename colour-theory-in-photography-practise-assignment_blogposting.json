Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Choose a location with varied colours and lighting conditions. • Gather a selection of objects or subjects that showcase different colours. • Set your camera to either aperture priority or shutter priority mode. • Fix your ISO at 200 to maintain consistent exposure. • Prepare to experiment with both warm and cool colour palettes. The Assignment Technical Focus • Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field while focusing on contrasting colours. • Experiment with different focal lengths to see how colour contrast changes with perspective. • Pay attention to natural light and how it affects colour perception. • Utilize backlighting to enhance the vibrancy of colours in your subjects. • Incorporate textures to add another layer of contrast to your images. Creative Focus • Explore the use of complementary colours in your compositions for maximum impact. • Create a series of images that juxtapose warm and cool colours. • Look for opportunities to contrast soft and hard textures within your colour compositions. • Use colour to convey emotions; for example, use warm colours to evoke energy and cool colours for calmness. • Tell a story through colour by selecting subjects that represent different emotions or themes. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a scene using aperture priority mode at f/4, ISO 200 fixed, focusing on contrasting warm and cool colours. • Capture a close-up of an object with a vibrant colour against a neutral background using aperture priority mode at f/2.8, ISO 200 fixed. • Create a diptych showcasing two images: one with high tonal contrast and the other with low tonal contrast, both shot in aperture priority mode with ISO 200. • Shoot an outdoor scene in the golden hour, focusing on the warm colours of the sunset using shutter priority mode at 1/250s, ISO 200 fixed. • Experiment with shadows and highlights in a black and white scene to emphasize tonal contrast, using aperture priority mode at f/5.6, ISO 200 fixed. • Capture a portrait that employs a contrasting colour background to highlight the subject’s features, using aperture priority mode at f/3.5, ISO 200 fixed. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a photo series that explores a single colour in various contexts and lighting conditions, using both aperture and shutter priority modes. • Develop a conceptual portrait project that tells a story through contrasting colours and tones, focusing on both emotional and physical contrasts. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do experiment with different lighting conditions to see how they affect colour perception. • ✓ Do pay attention to the background and its impact on the subject's colour. • ✓ Do take multiple shots with varying colour contrasts to find the most effective composition. • ✓ Do use editing software to enhance the colour contrast in your images post-shoot. • ✓ Do practice shooting in different environments to gain a broader understanding of colour theory. DON'T • ✗ Don't use overly bright or saturated colours without considering their context. • ✗ Don't ignore the effect of shadows on your composition's colour balance. • ✗ Don't rely solely on post-processing to create colour contrast; focus on capturing it in-camera. • ✗ Don't use distracting elements that compete with your main subject's colour. • ✗ Don't forget to consider the emotional impact of the colours you choose to include. Reflection Questions • How did the use of contrasting colours affect the mood of your photographs? • What challenges did you face while trying to capture colour contrast in your images? • In what ways did different lighting conditions influence your perception of colour? • How can understanding colour theory enhance your overall photography skills? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Contrast In Photography • → How To Improve Your Photography Composition For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
