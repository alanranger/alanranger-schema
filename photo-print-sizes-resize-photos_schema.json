Match the aspect ratio If the print ratio differs from your photo, you’ll need a crop or borders (photo sizes are 3:2 / 4:3 / 5:4; A-sizes are 1:√2). 5. Read the result * Excellent ≥300 PPI • Very Good ≥240 • Good ≥180 • Fair ≥150 * Viewing distance ≈ diagonal × 2 (bigger prints are viewed farther away) 6. Export confidently Crop to the print ratio, then export at the exact pixels & PPI shown.

You can easily calculate, reset, and even print the results for future reference.----------------------------------------WANT A PRO TO CHECK CROP, DPI & PAPER CHOICE?Book a 30-minute Print-Prep Session (£29)Book a 30-min Print-Prep Session (£29) ----------------------------------------PHOTO SIZING GUIDENowadays, few people choose to print images as it’s so much easier to share electronically through social media and photo websites. As such, many photographers don’t have the knowledge and understanding of print resolution, aspect ratios, mounting, paper choice and the plethora of challenges that come with making the print. In fairness, even as professional from the digital age, I must work things out each time I go to print, too, though I have done enough exhibitions and other print-related tasks to have a reasonable understanding. “The negative is comparable to the composer's score and the print to its performance. Each performance differs in subtle ways.” Ansel Adams Given that I have many clients, on various courses, and other events wishing to create prints, I felt a guide to the considerations and technicalities would be helpful.IMAGE ASPECT RATIOS: PHOT oser's score and the print to its performance. Each performance differs in subtle ways.” Ansel Adams Given that I have many clients, on various courses, and other events wishing to create prints, I felt a guide to the considerations and technicalities would be helpful.IMAGE ASPECT RATIOS: PHOTO SIZING GUIDESo, what about aspect ratios? In its simplest form, a print aspect ratio is a measurement of the width compared to the height, expressed as a ratio. For example, a full-frame image taken from an SLR camera, without any cropping, is in the ratio of 3:2. Alternatively, this can be expressed as the width of the image being 1.5 times the height of the image. How do aspect ratios relate to cropping? The image below is a full-frame 3:2 image. If we printed this as a 6×4” print, it would not need cropping, but what if we wanted this image in another standard print format – a 10×8”? This would, unfortunately, mean cropping part of the image –possibly a vital part of the composition. The reason is that although the 10×8” print is significantly larger than a 6×4”, its aspect ratio is 5:4. In other words, the larger 10×8” print’s aspect ratio is squarer.

It’s are more elongated than the 10×8” but squarer than the 6×4”. If this seems more confusing, think of in terms of the width as a multiple of the height (or just refer to this table below!). Remember the aspect ratio has nothing to do with the quality and size of the photo it is just the shape of the rectangle – viewing area.View fullsizeImage Size RatioPAPER SIZES: PHOTO SIZING GUIDE We are all familiar with standard paper sizes when it comes to office and home printers. However, the camera doesn’t naturally conform to those standard dimensions when we are printing a photo (uncropped) from a digital SLR camera. The camera photo dimensions (aspect ratio) are based on the sensor or film size, so do not fit the page size easily or equally (the same amount of white space around the photo) Therefore, we have to convert image size to fit standard paper sizes to fill as much of the paper area without cropping the image. Here you can see that the paper aspect ratios do not align perfectly to image aspect ratios. Nearly all the paper sizes in the table below have an aspect ratio of 1.41 which is the closet match to 7 x 5 image aspect ratio (1.4)View fullsizePaper sizes and ratioVIEWING DISTANCE AND PRINT RESOLUTION: PHOTO SIZING GUIDE If the calculation of paper size and image sizes was not already complicated enough, we also need to consider image resolution. Meaning acceptably sharp at “normal viewing distances”.Acceptably sharp is determined by the viewing distance and medium the image is presented on. Assuming you are printing images for viewing rather than seeing on as a projected image (or Mobile device and computer), then a viewing distance of . Meaning acceptably sharp at “normal viewing distances”.Acceptably sharp is determined by the viewing distance and medium the image is presented on. Assuming you are printing images for viewing rather than seeing on as a projected image (or Mobile device and computer), then a viewing distance of 1-3 feet (within arm’s length) is considered the normal range for determining sharpness and details of the print. How do you calculate minimum viewing distance? A generally accepted rule of thumb is that an appropriate minimum print viewing distance is simply the diagonal length of an image multiplied by 1.5 For example, a 36\" x 54\" image would have a diagonal length of about 64.9\". Multiplying 64.9\" by 1.5 results in a viewing distance of about 97.3\" or 8.1 feetView fullsizeViewing distance for photographsView fullsizeViewing DistancesIMAGE RESOLUTION: PHOTO PRINT SIZESIn addition to this the PPI needs to be sufficient to render the image sharp at that viewing distance and size of imagePPI stands for “pixels per inch.” The more pixels per inch, the higher the image resolution. You can see from the chart, below, that PPI, or resolution, is inversely related to the output size and viewing distance. The larger your output AND greater your viewing distance, the fewer pixels per inch that are needed in order to ensure sharp appearance.Therefore, the image resolution must be sufficient in megapixels to ensure you can produce a high-quality print at 200 PPI for minimal, and 300 PPI for high quality as close viewing distance and less than 200 PPI when viewing from greater distances.Pixels per inch (PPI) is a measure of the number of pixels in a digital image, which affects the quality of a printed image. A higher PPI generally results in a higher quality print.RECOMMENDED PPI FOR PRINT * 300 PPI: A good choice for high-quality prints, such as photos for magazines or brochures * 180–240 PPI: A common choice for non-commercial use or smaller designsHow PPI affects print qualityA higher PPI means more pixels per inch, so each pixel can be printed at a higher resolutionThis results in sharper images and smoother gradientsPPI FOR DIFFERENT PRINT JOBSFor small format prints, such as brochures or booklets, 300 PPI is recommendedFor large format prints, such as line images, 200 PPI is recommendedFor photographic images on canvas, 100 PPI is recommendedPPI FOR SCREENSHigher PPI also means more detailed and crisp images on a display. Modern smartphones and high-end monitors often have very high PPI ratingsFormula:View fullsizePrint resolution and PPIThe maths involved to come up with that size print is to first divide the number of pixels in the width of the file by the 200 DPI. (2,000/200=10). Next, divide the number of pixels in the height of the file by 200. (1600/200=8). So, there you have it. A file size of 2,000 pixels X 1600 pixels can be printed to make a good quality 10 X 8 photo when printed at 200 DPI. If you decide to make a print at 300DPI from the same image file, you will have a print with better resolution. However, the maximum size for a quality print will be smaller. The maths would be.... 2,000/300=6.8. Next, 1,600/300=5.3. So, if you round the numbers out, the maximum standard size for that print will be about 7 X 5. The key connection to viewing distance here is that due to the optics of the human eye, a print that is 3x farther away requires exactly 3x less res",
