  "articleBody": "Case Study - Jacki Rosin ARPS | RPS Distinctions Panel View fullsize Jacki Rosin ARPS Panel RPS Distinctions Jacki has been a client from the early days of me starting photography tuition as a full time profession, about 8 years ago. was delighted when she gave in to my persuasion to go for RPS distinctions Jacki attended my beginners photography and Lightroom courses some years ago and followed up on those with doing the Intentions Photography Course which ended in a public exhibition in 2015. Jacki’s project for Intentions was still life floral shots so having taken her idea through to exhibition with a good range of superb shots it was an easy transition (easy for me, not for her) to take this to the next level to produce fifteen shots worthy of a the Associate Distinction with the RPS. I am not entirely sure how many of the original shots from her Intentions course remain in the final panel but importantly the work completed then and further development of the concept has culminated in a successful A panel a few years later. I am particularly happy with this, the second successful A panel this month, because Jacki had some bad news to deal with a several months ago and understandably wasn’t motivated to carry on, but with a little arm twisting (something I always have to do with Jacki) she thankfully continued and has now been rewarded, rightly so, with this recognition and achievement of her creative photography skills. I am sure Jacki would confirm that sometimes having a focus when other, more important, things are occupying your mind that photography can be a great outlet. It has always been a pleasure to mentor and tutor Jackie in all aspects of photography and I am also proud to call her a friend too. Jackie has been a great supporter of my business, the Facebook Forum and the charitable photography activities we have worked on together over the years. Thank you for your custom, friendship and support and I wish you every success in your ongoing photography development, health and happiness. Jacki RPS Hanging Plan for ARPS - click to see large Jacki Rosin Statement of Intent Apart from photography, I have two other major interests - flowers and painting. This panel represents a combination of all three. The flowers are positioned as botanical specimens, but I wanted to interpret them in a creative style. By focus stacking certain elements of each flower and leaving some areas to fall out of focus I have attempted to concentrate attention to specific areas. This effect is intensified by overlaying textures in post-processing, which softens part of each image, thus giving more of an impression of a painting. Brushing away the textures in varying degrees retains the shape, form and fine details of each image, allowing complex structures within the flowers to be clearly appreciated The muted tones and pastel colours of the textures I have applied hopefully bring cohesion to the panel and a balance of light to enhance the beauty of the flowers. Word Count 150 Interview with Jacki following her RPS Distinctions Achievement1. Why did you want to gain a distinction with the Royal Photographic Society (RPS)? To be honest, I had not thought about doing a distinction, but once Alan had suggested the idea I thought that having such a goal to reach would help me develop my photography 2. Why did you choose Alan to mentor you for a distinction and had you worked with Alan before the RPS Distinctions Mentoring Course? Alan has mentored me over the last few years. I respect his advice. 3. Describe how you found the RPS Distinctions Mentoring Classes. The classes were very helpful in that not only did you have your own work looked at in detail but you were also able to see how others were progressing. Everyone collaborated ideas and suggestions, so there was a lot of support and feedback, not just from Alan but from others on the same journey 4. Do you feel you got the right level and input of support from the course? Yes, definitely 5. Did you feel you were already good enough to gain a distinction with the RPS before you started the mentoring course? No, but I don’t think Alan would have contemplated the idea if he didn’t think I had some potential 6. What distinction did you apply for and were you successful? ARPS and yes. 7. What was your experience like of the RPS Assessment Day? I attended an RPS advisory day about halfway into the course and my panel changed quite a lot as a result. I then applied for online advice when I felt that I was almost ready to be assessed. Again a few tweaks but it helped to consolidate my panel 8. Did you seek independent advice, feedback or input from anywhere else before your panel assessment? I attended an advisory day before my assessment, which I found really useful. I had my prints professionally printed and mounted and sought their advice on suitable papers and mounts to use. 9. Having completed the course and Distinction Assessment, what advice would you like to share with others? You have to be prepared to put in a lot of time and effort. Sometimes it’s difficult to keep the enthusiasm going, especially when images are rejected, but eventually, you will see your panel beginning to come together 10. What was the hardest part of gaining a distinction with the RPS and why? Producing 15 images that were varied enough for the judges, but that also worked cohesively to produce a panel 11. Has working for a distinction helped you progress as a photographer? Yes. 12. Any other comments you would like to add.
