By practicing specific tasks, you'll gain confidence in capturing sharp images of both static and moving subjects.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the difference between autofocus modes and when to use them * Develop skills in tracking moving subjects with appropriate focus settings * Learn to prioritize focus points to achieve sharp images in various scenariosWANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Familiarize yourself with your camera's autofocus settings and modes * Select a suitable location with dynamic subjects (e.g., people, wildlife, sports) * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 for consistent exposure * Ensure your lens is clean to avoid distortion in your images * Practice locating and selecting focus points manually on your cameraTHE ASSIGNMENTTECHNI a suitable location with dynamic subjects (e.g., people, wildlife, sports) * Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 for consistent exposure * Ensure your lens is clean to avoid distortion in your images * Practice locating and selecting focus points manually on your cameraTHE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use AF-C (Continuous AF) mode when photographing moving subjects * Select a single point focus area for precise control over your focus point * Utilize back-button focus for better timing and to avoid focus-recomposing errors * Maintain a shutter speed fast enough to freeze motion based on your focal length * Experiment with different focus area settings (e.g., zone, expanded) based on subject sizeCREATIVE FOCUS * Capture portraits by focusing on the subject's closest eye for sharpness * Try to anticipate the movement of your subject and pre-focus on expected points of action * Play with depth of field by using aperture priority to isolate your subject from the background * Use leading lines to direct attention towards your focused subject in the composition * Experiment with different angles and distances to find unique perspectives on your subjectsASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Use shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a moving subject like a cyclist or a pet in action. 2. Set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, and photograph a portrait, ensuring to focus on the nearest eye. 3. In a crowded area, use AF-C mode with a single point focus to track a moving child playing in the park. 4. Practice using back-button focus while shooting a bird in flight, utilizing shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed. 5. Find a subject with repetitive movement (like a dancer) and use aperture priority at f/4 with ISO 200 to capture sharp images while blurring the background. 6. Set your camera to AF-C mode and photograph a car driving by using shutter priority at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, ensuring to keep the leading edge of the car in focus.💡 Stretch Tasks * Challenge yourself to capture a sports event using a zone focus area setting to track multiple players in motion. * Create a series of images with varying depth of field while focusing on the same subject, switching between different aperture settings.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do match your autofocus mode to your subject's movement (AF-C for moving subjects). * ✓ Do prioritize the eye as the focus point when photographing people. * ✓ Do practice using different focus areas to see which works best for various subjects. * ✓ Do keep your camera steady using a tripod or stabilizing techniques, especially at slower shutter speeds. * ✓ Do review your images after shooting to assess focus accuracy and make adjustments for next time.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely on focus-recompose techniques when using wide apertures, as this can lead to missed focus. * ✗ Don't use AF-S mode for subjects that are in motion, as it will not track them effectively. * ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistent exposure. * ✗ Don't forget to check your focus point before taking a shot, especially in crowded scenes. * ✗ Don't shoot without considering your shutter speed relative to your focal length to avoid motion blur.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did changing autofocus modes affect your ability to capture sharp images of moving subjects? * What challenges did you face when trying to focus on the nearest eye ✗ Don't shoot without considering your shutter speed relative to your focal length to avoid motion blur.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did changing autofocus modes affect your ability to capture sharp images of moving subjects? * What challenges did you face when trying to focus on the nearest eye during portrait photography? * In what scenarios did you find back-button focus to be particularly useful or challenging? * How does depth of field influence the way you compose your shots, especially with moving subjects?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Focus In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
