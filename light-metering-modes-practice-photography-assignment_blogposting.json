Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Familiarize yourself with your camera's metering mode settings. • Set your camera to Aperture Priority mode with ISO 200 fixed. • Choose a location with varying light conditions (e.g., shadows and bright areas). • Make sure your battery is charged and memory card is empty. • Have a notebook or digital device to record your settings and observations. The Assignment Technical Focus • Use Matrix metering for general scenes to start. • Switch to Centre-weighted metering for portrait photography. • Implement Spot metering when photographing subjects with high contrast backgrounds. • Adjust exposure compensation to +1 to +2 EV for bright scenes. • Use the histogram to check for highlight clipping after taking a shot. Creative Focus • Experiment with different metering modes to see how they affect the final image. • Use Centre-weighted metering to create balanced portraits that highlight the subject. • Incorporate Spot metering to draw attention to specific details in high-contrast scenes. • Try shooting in a variety of lighting conditions to challenge your metering skills. • Vary your exposure compensation to explore creative effects in your images. Assignment Tasks • Using Aperture Priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, photograph a bright outdoor scene and use Matrix metering to capture a well-exposed image. • Switch to Centre-weighted metering and take a portrait shot in natural light, ensuring the subject is correctly exposed while the background is slightly darker. • Find a scene with harsh lighting contrasts, such as backlit subjects, and use Spot metering to focus on the subject's face, adjusting the exposure as necessary. • Photograph a snowy landscape using Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, applying +1 to +2 EV exposure compensation to avoid underexposure. • Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, and use Spot metering to capture a subject in motion against a bright background, ensuring correct exposure. • Use Aperture Priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, photograph a scene at dusk using Centre-weighted metering, and then check the histogram for highlight warnings. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Shoot a series of images using all three metering modes in various lighting conditions, comparing the results to see which mode performs best for each situation. • Create a portfolio of images that showcase the impact of exposure compensation adjustments on your photographs. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do practice switching between metering modes based on the scene. • ✓ Do use exposure compensation to correct for tricky lighting conditions. • ✓ Do verify your exposure using the histogram after each shot. • ✓ Do take notes on how different metering modes affect your images. • ✓ Do experiment with both Aperture and Shutter Priority modes to see their effects on exposure. DON'T • ✗ Don't rely solely on Matrix metering for all scenes without considering the subject. • ✗ Don't ignore the importance of exposure compensation in high contrast situations. • ✗ Don't forget to check your histogram for clipping after taking a shot. • ✗ Don't switch to Manual mode unless you are fully confident in your exposure settings. • ✗ Don't assume the camera's metering will always provide the correct exposure without adjustments. Reflection Questions • How does the choice of metering mode influence the mood of your photographs? • What challenges did you face when using Spot metering, and how did you overcome them? • In what situations did you find Centre-weighted metering most effective, and why? • How can you apply your understanding of metering modes to improve your future photography? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Metering In Photography • → Exposure Bracketing A Guide For Photographers • → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
