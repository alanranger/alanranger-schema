By understanding the principles of compositional balance, students will learn to guide viewers' eyes through their images, enhancing visual interest.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Identify and apply the principles of visual weight in compositions. * Utilize negative space to stabilize and balance images. * Experiment with different placements of subjects to enhance flow and tension.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Read the article on compositional balance to understand visual weight and flow. * Choose a location with varied subjects, such as a park or urban setting. * Prepare your camera by setting the ISO to 200. * Decide on the type of images you want to create (e.g., portraits, landscapes). * Gather any props or additional elements you might want to include in your shots.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority park or urban setting. * Prepare your camera by setting the ISO to 200. * Decide on the type of images you want to create (e.g., portraits, landscapes). * Gather any props or additional elements you might want to include in your shots.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field while maintaining a fixed ISO of 200. * Pay attention to the edges of the frame to avoid distractions. * Experiment with different focal lengths to see how they affect visual weight. * Utilize leading lines in your compositions to enhance flow. * Consider the horizon line and its placement in the frame for balance.CREATIVE FOCUS * Explore contrasting colors to create visual tension and focus. * Utilize light and shadow to enhance the three-dimensional feel of your subjects. * Incorporate movement within the frame to guide the viewer's eye. * Experiment with off-center compositions to create dynamic tension. * Use reflections or patterns to create visual interest and lead the viewer's eye.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Photograph a scene where you intentionally use negative space to create balance, using aperture priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed. 2. Capture a portrait where the subject is placed off-center, making use of leading lines to guide the viewer's eye, using aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed. 3. Create an image where contrasting elements (e.g., light and dark, large and small) are used to establish visual weight, using aperture priority mode at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed. 4. Shoot a landscape where the horizon is placed either on the top or bottom third of the frame to explore balance, using aperture priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed. 5. Take a series of three images of the same subject from different angles to observe how flow changes, using aperture priority mode at f/3.5 with ISO 200 fixed. 6. Photograph an urban scene that incorporates architectural elements with varying heights to explore visual weight, using aperture priority mode at f/6.3 with ISO 200 fixed.💡 Stretch Tasks * Create a diptych or triptych that showcases contrasting visual weights between images while maintaining a cohesive flow. * Experiment with long exposure techniques to capture movement in a busy scene, using shutter priority mode at 1/15s with ISO 200 fixed.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do analyze your compositions for visual weight before taking the shot. * ✓ Do use negative space intentionally to create balance. * ✓ Do adjust your viewpoint to enhance the flow of your images. * ✓ Do consider the colors and tones in your composition for visual impact. * ✓ Do continuously review and adjust your framing to maintain balance.DON'T * ✗ Don't overcrowd your frame with too many subjects; aim for simplicity. * ✗ Don't forget to scan the edges of your frame for distractions. * ✗ Don't rely solely on symmetry; explore asymmetrical balance. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of light and how it affects visual weight. * ✗ Don't shoot without considering how the viewer’s eye will flow through your image.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How did the use of negative space in your images impact their overall balance? * What changes did you notice in visual weight when adjusting the subject's position? * How did the colors and tones in your composition affect the viewer's perception? * In what ways did you find flow in your images, and how can you improve it in future shoots?📚 RELATED READING",
