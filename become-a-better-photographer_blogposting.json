It doesn’t take rocket science to turn your everyday snaps into inspiring pieces of art, worthy of comment; using my knowledge, I have written this step-by-step guide on how to grow your photography skills:TOOLS OF THE TRADE ARE ESSENTIAL.It’s not necessary to have the biggest and best camera on the market – or even to possess a digital camera. Film cameras are just as relevant and useful today as they were prior to the digital age. The most important thing is to get suitable equipment for your individual requirements and expertise.HAVE YOUR CAMERA AT THE READYCarry your camera around with you, whenever possible. You might find yourself suddenly looking at a stunning scene: but if your camera isn’t with you, you miss out on what potentially may have been your best shot to date. However, it is rare for these opportunities to just present themselves to you. You need to get out into the world and look for them. Day or night, dry or wet, warm or cold – all conditions are perfect for the right photo, at the right time.INSPIRATION IS EVERYWHEREThere are so many colours, textures and patterns around you just waiting to be discovered and incorporated into original and stunning photographs. I offer a ran m. Day or night, dry or wet, warm or cold – all conditions are perfect for the right photo, at the right time.INSPIRATION IS EVERYWHEREThere are so many colours, textures and patterns around you just waiting to be discovered and incorporated into original and stunning photographs. I offer a range of workshops where you can learn so much in the beautiful British outdoors. Hone your skills and create enchanting photos for people to admire and enjoy. You can even customise your tuition to suit your specific needs with my pick and mix tuition packages.SIMPLICITY IS BEAUTYAvoid trying to focus on too much at once. If there is something that doesn’t add anything to the composition of the shot, then it doesn’t need to be included. Keep it simple and you’ll get a much more focused shot.SHARE YOUR WORKAn important part of your development is sharing your photos with the world and receiving feedback. Listening to constructive criticism from other artists is one of the best ways to improve the way you work. They’ll understand the impact you would like your photos to have; they may see ways as to how you can tailor your skills to achieve those goals. Full constructive feedback is given throughout all my courses, together with ongoing support, taking you further along the creative journey of the craft of photography.KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT - BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHERKnowing all about the extras on high-tech digital cameras isn’t essential, but it is useful in getting the most out of your shots. Don’t be afraid to experiment with your equipment as well as researching the range of tools available to you.FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH HOW YOU WORK - BECOME A BETTER PHOTOGRAPHERDo you feel at your best out in the elements of nature or surrounded by busy town life?

I’d love to receive comments, and everyone has their own perspective on life.I take great pleasure in teaching and developing photography skills.
