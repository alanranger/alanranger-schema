By practicing specific tasks, students will learn to select the appropriate metering mode based on the scene and how to manipulate exposure for optimal results.LEARNING OBJECTIVES * Understand the differences between Matrix, Centre-weighted, and Spot metering modes. * Learn to adjust exposure compensation based on scene brightness. * Utilize histograms and highlight warnings to verify exposure accuracy.WANT FEEDBACK ON YOUR ASSIGNMENT?Join Foundation Plus and get personalised monthly critique plus full access to all assignments.Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF BEFORE YOU SHOOT * Familiarize yourself with your camera's metering mode settings. * Set your camera to Aperture Priority mode with ISO 200 fixed. * Choose a location with varying light conditions (e.g., shadows and bright areas). * Make sure your battery is charged and memory card is empty. * Have a notebook or digital device to record your settings and observations.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use Matrix metering fo 200 fixed. * Choose a location with varying light conditions (e.g., shadows and bright areas). * Make sure your battery is charged and memory card is empty. * Have a notebook or digital device to record your settings and observations.THE ASSIGNMENTTECHNICAL FOCUS * Use Matrix metering for general scenes to start. * Switch to Centre-weighted metering for portrait photography. * Implement Spot metering when photographing subjects with high contrast backgrounds. * Adjust exposure compensation to +1 to +2 EV for bright scenes. * Use the histogram to check for highlight clipping after taking a shot.CREATIVE FOCUS * Experiment with different metering modes to see how they affect the final image. * Use Centre-weighted metering to create balanced portraits that highlight the subject. * Incorporate Spot metering to draw attention to specific details in high-contrast scenes. * Try shooting in a variety of lighting conditions to challenge your metering skills. * Vary your exposure compensation to explore creative effects in your images.ASSIGNMENT TASKS 1. Using Aperture Priority mode at f/4 with ISO 200 fixed, photograph a bright outdoor scene and use Matrix metering to capture a well-exposed image. 2. Switch to Centre-weighted metering and take a portrait shot in natural light, ensuring the subject is correctly exposed while the background is slightly darker. 3. Find a scene with harsh lighting contrasts, such as backlit subjects, and use Spot metering to focus on the subject's face, adjusting the exposure as necessary. 4. Photograph a snowy landscape using Aperture Priority mode at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, applying +1 to +2 EV exposure compensation to avoid underexposure. 5. Set your camera to Shutter Priority mode at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, and use Spot metering to capture a subject in motion against a bright background, ensuring correct exposure. 6. Use Aperture Priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, photograph a scene at dusk using Centre-weighted metering, and then check the histogram for highlight warnings.💡 Stretch Tasks * Shoot a series of images using all three metering modes in various lighting conditions, comparing the results to see which mode performs best for each situation. * Create a portfolio of images that showcase the impact of exposure compensation adjustments on your photographs.DO / DON'TDO * ✓ Do practice switching between metering modes based on the scene. * ✓ Do use exposure compensation to correct for tricky lighting conditions. * ✓ Do verify your exposure using the histogram after each shot. * ✓ Do take notes on how different metering modes affect your images. * ✓ Do experiment with both Aperture and Shutter Priority modes to see their effects on exposure.DON'T * ✗ Don't rely solely on Matrix metering for all scenes without considering the subject. * ✗ Don't ignore the importance of exposure compensation in high contrast situations. * ✗ Don't forget to check your histogram for clipping after taking a shot. * ✗ Don't switch to Manual mode unless you are fully confident in your exposure settings. * ✗ Don't assume the camera's metering will always provide the correct exposure without adjustments.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does the choice of metering mode influence the mood of your photographs? * What challenges did you face when using Spot metering, and how did you overcome them? * In what situations did you find Centre-weighted metering most effect rrect exposure without adjustments.REFLECTION QUESTIONS * How does the choice of metering mode influence the mood of your photographs? * What challenges did you face when using Spot metering, and how did you overcome them? * In what situations did you find Centre-weighted metering most effective, and why? * How can you apply your understanding of metering modes to improve your future photography?📚 RELATED READINGBefore you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: * → What Is Metering In Photography * → Exposure Bracketing A Guide For Photographers * → What Is Dynamic Range In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
