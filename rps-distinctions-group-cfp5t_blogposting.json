The Royal Photographic Society exists to promote photography and image-making and to support photographers in realising their potential, irrespective of their level of knowledge, equipment or skills. Having supported many clients through a journey of development and improvement, with their photography, over the past few years, I was aware that there is a growing group who have considered and are interested in going for accreditation with the RPS. Therefore I launched the RPS Group in February 2018. The course of classes will stretch your creative interpretation, technical camera execution, editing ability and finally the skill to pull together a panel of coherent images into a panel and set of prints of digital images for projection. I am pleased to say that after three years of launching the course we are making great progress with several more participants already reaching 75% or more of a draft panel that will be ready for submission this year. Plus a 100% success pass rate to date with nine clients achieving their distinctions. The collaborative format of each class is proving to be popular and a great way to get ideas, inspiration and discuss images collectively. If you are interested in joining this course and giving yourself a target to work on an image collection for RPS Distinction please get in touch to discuss or just book online. You can enrol at any time and join a class to suit your pace and availability. Future RPS distinctions Class Dates: RPS Classes RPS Distinction Requirements Professional Recognition with RPSLICENTIATE OF THE RPS (LRPS) Requires 10 images that reflect your ability as a photographer. ASSOCIATE OF THE RPS (ARPS) Requires a body of work/project of 15 images of a high standard and a written Statement of Intent. I have previously supported a few clients in achieving their distinctions - RPS Case Studies so have experience of providing the mentoring and tuition to help you achieve this goal. To date, I have a 100% success record in mentoring clients to a successful pass rate, seven L’s and two A’s. Additionally, my own experience and knowledge mean I am well positioned to offer insight and guide you through the process. Distinction Group - Cost and Commitment • You will sign up for six classes within a twelve-month period. There will be an option to extend for more than six classes or a longer period if you need a bit of extra time and support Just let me know what class dates you would like to attend, when you know and have work to review.
