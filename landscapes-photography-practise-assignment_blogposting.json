Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Choose a natural landscape location that inspires you, such as a park, beach, or mountain. • Check the weather forecast to identify optimal lighting conditions (golden hour or blue hour). • Plan your shoot time to coincide with the best light conditions. • Pack essential gear including a tripod, wide-angle lens, and filters. • Charge your camera batteries and ensure you have enough memory cards for the session. The Assignment Technical Focus • Use aperture priority mode to control depth of field, setting it at f/8 for sharpness across the landscape. • Utilize fixed ISO 200 to minimize noise while letting the camera adjust shutter speed as needed. • Experiment with long exposures for water or cloud movement by using a tripod and a neutral density filter. • Bracketing exposures can help capture a range of highlights and shadows in dynamic lighting. • Consider using a polarizing filter to enhance colors and reduce glare in your landscape shots. Creative Focus • Incorporate leading lines in your composition to guide the viewer's eye through the image. • Use foreground elements to add depth and scale to your landscape photographs. • Anchor your composition with a clear focal point that draws attention. • Experiment with different angles and perspectives to find unique compositions. • Capture the landscape at various times of day to explore how light changes the scene. Assignment Tasks • Visit a local natural park during golden hour, using aperture priority mode set at f/8 with ISO 200 fixed, and capture at least three different compositions focusing on leading lines. • Choose a water body, use shutter priority mode set at 1/4s with ISO 200 fixed, and create a long exposure shot to capture the smooth movement of the water. • Find a viewpoint that showcases a vast landscape, using aperture priority mode set at f/11 with ISO 200 fixed, to ensure maximum depth of field. • Take a series of images at different times of day in the same location to observe how the light affects the landscape, using aperture priority mode throughout. • Select a scene with dramatic clouds and use shutter priority mode set at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to freeze the motion of the clouds. • Create a composition that includes both a foreground element and a distant background, using aperture priority mode set at f/5.6 with ISO 200 fixed to balance focus throughout the scene. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a high dynamic range (HDR) image by taking multiple exposures at different settings, using a tripod to maintain composition. • Shoot a panorama of a wide landscape scene, ensuring to overlap images by about a third for a seamless blend. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do plan your shoots around the best lighting conditions for landscape photography. • ✓ Do use a tripod to stabilize your camera for longer exposures. • ✓ Do experiment with different compositions and perspectives to find your unique style. • ✓ Do keep the natural environment as the main focus of your landscape images. • ✓ Do shoot in RAW format to retain maximum detail for post-processing. DON'T • ✗ Don't rush your shots; take time to compose your images carefully. • ✗ Don't ignore the weather conditions as they can dramatically change the mood of your photographs. • ✗ Don't forget to check your camera settings before starting to shoot. • ✗ Don't include man-made objects in your landscape images if they distract from the natural scene. • ✗ Don't rely solely on the camera's auto mode; practice using priority modes for better creative control. Reflection Questions • How did the natural light conditions influence your landscape photographs? • What compositional techniques worked best in your images, and why? • Reflect on a challenging shot: what did you learn about your approach to landscape photography? • How does the use of foreground elements change the perception of depth in your photos? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → Mastering Landscape Photography Tips And Techniques • → Finding Your Compositional Balance For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
