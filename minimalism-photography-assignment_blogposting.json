The Assignment Technical Focus • Use a wide aperture (f/2.8) to create a shallow depth of field, isolating your subject from the background. • Set a shutter speed of 1/125s to ensure sharpness while capturing your subject. • Adjust ISO to 100 for optimal image quality in well-lit conditions. • Utilize spot metering to ensure your subject is correctly exposed. • Set your white balance to daylight to maintain accurate color representation. Creative Focus • Explore the use of negative space to direct attention to your subject. • Experiment with symmetry and asymmetry in your compositions. • Incorporate geometric shapes and lines to create visual interest. • Limit your color palette to enhance simplicity and focus. • Utilize natural light to create soft shadows and highlights. Assignment Tasks • Photograph a single object with a plain white background using settings: f/2.8, 1/125s, ISO 100, in aperture priority mode. Focus on the subject to create a strong focal point. • Capture a minimalist still life with three objects arranged in a triangular composition. Use settings: f/4, 1/60s, ISO 200, in manual mode. Ensure the background is uncluttered to emphasize the simplicity. • Take a close-up shot of a single flower against a blurred background. Use settings: f/3.5, 1/200s, ISO 100, in aperture priority mode. This will enhance the flower's details while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. • Photograph an empty landscape or seascape at sunrise or sunset. Use settings: f/8, 1/250s, ISO 100, in manual mode. Focus on the horizon line to create balance and tranquility. • Find a minimalist architectural structure and photograph it from a low angle. Use settings: f/5.6, 1/125s, ISO 200, in aperture priority mode. Capture the lines and shapes that define the architecture. • Create a monochrome image of a simple object, focusing on texture and form. Use settings: f/2.8, 1/100s, ISO 400, in manual mode. Convert to black and white in post-processing to enhance minimalism. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Create a series of three images that tell a story through minimalism, using different subjects and settings. Maintain consistent camera settings across all images. • Develop a photo essay that explores minimalism in everyday life, focusing on the beauty of simplicity in common objects.
