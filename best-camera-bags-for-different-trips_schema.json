MESSENGER BAG: THE IDEAL COMPANION FOR DAY TRIPS For day trips or outings, a messenger-style bag is ferent photographic scenarios, drawing from my personal experiences in the field.View fullsizeMessenger BagView fullsizeSmall BackpackView fullsizeLarger Camera Backpacks 1. MESSENGER BAG: THE IDEAL COMPANION FOR DAY TRIPS For day trips or outings, a messenger-style bag is the perfect companion. It offers quick and easy access to your camera, lenses, and essential accessories, all while you're on the move. With a capacity of ten to fifteen litres, it can comfortably hold all your necessities, from spare batteries to a water bottle, allowing you to focus on capturing the perfect shot without the hassle of setting the bag down. 2. SMALL BACKPACK: VERSATILE FOR ONE-DAY PHOTOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS For one-day photography outings or workshops, a small backpack with a capacity between twelve and twenty litres is an excellent choice. These bags can accommodate a camera body, typically two lenses, filters, two spare batteries, a tripod, and a variety of smaller accessories while providing space for additional clothing layers and snacks. When you'll be out for extended periods ranging from three to eight hours, a comfortable backpack that can be worn while hiking or trekking up and down hills is essential. 3. LARGER BACKPACK: IDEAL FOR MULTI-DAY PHOTOGRAPHY ADVENTURES For multi-day events or workshops, a giant backpack with a capacity between twenty and thirty litres becomes necessary. In addition to the gear required for one-day outings, such as a camera body, lenses, filters, chargers, and clothing layers, these backpacks offer ample space for additional lenses and accessories. Comfort and overall weight distribution are crucial considerations when selecting a larger backpack, as you'll likely be carrying it for extended periods while walking or trekking.In this article, I compare these three camera bags of different sizes and styles and share my verdict. Manfrotto and Lowepro kindly provided me with these bags to review, and whilst I haven’t tested them all in the field individually, I have sufficient experience to know how they feel when loaded, which I did, and how they would be utilised when using them.FEATURES TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A CAMERA BAGBefore we dive into the specifics of each camera bag, let's discuss the key features to consider when selecting the perfect photography companion: 1. Capacity and Compartments: The camera bag should have ample space to accommodate your camera body, lenses, and other essential accessories. Dedicated compartments and dividers help keep your gear organised and secure. 2. Protection: Your camera equipment is an investment worth protecting. Look for camera bags with padded interiors, water-resistant materials, and robust construction to safeguard your gear from bumps, drops, and inclement weather. 3. Comfort and Ergonomics: As a photographer, you'll often find yourself on the move, carrying your camera bag for extended periods. Padded shoulder straps, back panels, and adjustable hip belts can significantly improve comfort and distribute weight evenly. 4. Accessibility: Quick access to your camera and lenses is essential for capturing fleeting moments. Look for backpacks with side or top openings, which allow you to retrieve your gear without having to remove the entire pack. 5. Additional Features: Extras like tripod holders, rain covers, and laptop compartments can enhance the backpack's functionality and versatility.------------------ ents.

While cameras and lenses are essential tools, a reliable and functional camera bag is equally crucial. In this article, we will delve into the world of messenger camera bags, specifically comparing two popular options: the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III and the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II.Messenger camera bags have become a popular choice among photographers due to their versatility and convenience. These bags are designed to carry camera equipment while providing easy access, making them ideal for on-the-go shooting. With their sleek and stylish appearance, messenger bags blend seamlessly into urban environments, allowing photographers to move freely without drawing unnecessary attention.COMPARISON - MANFROTTO ADVANCED MESSENGER CAMERA BAG M III VERSUS LOWEPRO PROTACTIC MG 160 AW IILowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIKey Features:Design: Messenger style. Tactical, rugged design with modular accessories.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Top access for quick camera retrieval, side and front pockets for additional storageMaterials: Durable. Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover built into base of bagAdditional Features: SlipLock compatible attachment loops for additional pouches and accessories plus small laptop spaceCapacity: 14LCamera Gear: DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lenses, and a flash.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. External side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £95Weight: 1.4kgDimensions:Internal: 37 x 14 x 25.5 cmExternal: 40 x 17 x 28 cmPros:* Highly durable and robust, suitable for demanding environments.* Excellent weather protection with AW Cover.* Modular design allows for customisation with additional pouches and accessories.Cons:* Heavier and bulkier than some other camera bags.* Tactical design may not be as versatile for all settings.My Verdict: 8/10It certainly meets my criteria for a short trip out with the camera, and with a couple of lenses and the little extras I need to stuff away somewhere outside of my clothing pockets. The front opening flap is a little annoying but does provide protection when the top of the bag is exposed to the elements. The flexible dividers in the bag are useful but slightly flimsy. But for me, the absence of quick access from the top to the camera inside the bag without opening the main bag flap is an irritant.More Information / Buy View fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIView fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIView fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIView fullsizeLowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW IIManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIKey Features:Design: Sleek, modern messenger bag design with a comfortable shoulder strap.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Quick access to top zipper and multiple external pockets for accessories.Materials: Durable.Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover - separa :Design: Sleek, modern messenger bag design with a comfortable shoulder strap.Protection: Padded interior with customisable dividers.Access: Quick access to top zipper and multiple external pockets for accessories.Materials: Durable.Water-repellant fabric with included protective rain cover - separate item (not built in) Additional Features: Dedicated padded compartment for a tablet or small laptop or other accessoriesCapacity: 16LCamera Gear: DSLR or mirrorless camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lenses, and a flash.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. External side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £79Weight: 1.09kgDimensions:Internal: 36 x 13 x 26 cmExternal: 39 x 19.5 x 28 cmPros:* Stylish and unobtrusive design suitable for everyday use.* Lightweight and easy to carry.* Good organisational features for smaller accessories.Cons:* Limited capacity compared to larger camera bags.* Might not fit larger professional camera bodies or lenses.My Verdict: 10/10Ticks lots of boxes for a day out with the camera and all your accessories and essential storage on your hip. Comfortable strapping and quick easy access with the top opening make it more practical for the travelling photographer or day-tripper. The inner divider sections are stiff making it easy to divide up the internal space to suit your gear. Even though both comparison bags are similar in dimensions, the Manfrotto Messenger bag feels naturally more roomy and easier.More Information / Buy View fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIView fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIView fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIIView fullsizeManfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M IIICOMPARISON SUMMARY: * Capacity: Both bags offer similar capacities for camera gear, though the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III may accommodate slightly more personal items. * Design: The Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III features a sleek, modern design ideal for everyday use, while the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II has a rugged, tactical look suitable for more demanding conditions. * Protection: The Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II offers superior weather protection with its All Weather AW Cover, whereas the Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III focuses more on internal padding and water-repellent fabric. * Access: Both bags provide quick access to camera gear, but the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II offers additional modularity and external storage options. * Additional Features: The Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II's modular design and SlipLock system offer greater customisation for users needing to expand their carrying capacity.Overall, the choice between these two bags will depend on the user's specific needs: the Manfrotto Advanced Messenger Camera Bag M III is great for everyday use with a sleek design, while the Lowepro ProTactic MG 160 AW II is better suited for more rugged and customisable requirements.----------------------------------------INTRODUCTION TO SMALL CAMERA BACKPACKSAs a passionate photographer, having the right gear is crucial for capturing those breathtaking moments. One essential piece of equipment that often gets overlooked is the camera backpack. It's not just a vessel for carrying your precious camera and lenses; it's a companion that ensures your equipment is protected, easily accessible, and comfortable during those long photog those breathtaking moments.

We'll compare their features, pros, and cons, helping you determine which one best suits your photography needs and lifestyle.COMPARISON - LOWEPRO TREKKER LITE BP 150 AW, BLACK VERSUS MANFROTTO STREET CAMERA SLIM BACKPACKLowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, BlackKey Features:Design: Lightweight and versatile backpack.Protection: All Weather AW Cover for protection against the elements.Access: Rear and side access to gear, multiple compartments.Materials: Durable, eco-friendly fabric made from recycled materials.Additional Features: CradleFit compartment for a 15-inch laptop or tablet, adjustable dividers.Capacity: 18.5LCamera Gear: Mirrorless camera with attached small lens and accessories.Personal Items: Space for small personal items. Some clothing and external side pocket for bottleCost: Approximately £99Weight: 0.9kgDimensions:Internal: 26 x 11 x 44 cmExternal: 26 x 15 x 45 cmPros:* Excellent protection with the All Weather AW Cover, ensuring gear is safe in various weather conditions.* Made from durable, eco-friendly fabric produced from recycled materials.* Comfortable padding on straps for shoulders and your backCons:* Bulkier Design: Slightly bulkier compared to slim profile backpacks, which may not be ideal for all settings.* The camera compartment is very small and only suited to the mirrorless camera body with one small lens attached* Lacks configurable dividers for camera section in the bagMy Verdict:6/10Despite having a larger overall capacity over the similar external dimensions of the Manfrotto I couldn't configure it satisfactorily to accommodate the same amount of camera gear, accessories and clothing items as quickly as the Manfrotto Street Slimpack. I do like the ability to take the camera cube out from the bag and use as a shoulder bag independantly but feel it suits much smaller camera bodies and smaller lenses than my own requirements. The padding and comfort is better than the Manfrotto equivalent.More Information / Buy View fullsizeLowepro Trekker Lite BP 150 AW, BlackView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsizeView fullsize----------------------------------------View fullsizeManfrotto Street Slim Camera BackpackKey Features:Design: Slim, stylish, and compact, making it ideal for urban environments and lighter loads.Protection: Padded compartments for camera gear.Access: Front and top access to gear, quick-access pockets.Materials: Durable, water-repellent fabric.Additional Features: Dedicated compartment for a 14-inch laptop, adjustable dividersCapacity: 15LCamera Gear: Mirrorless or compact DSLR camera with attached lens, 1-2 additional lensesPersonal Items: Space for small personal items.
