Learn More & Join Download Assignment PDF Before You Shoot • Familiarize yourself with your camera's autofocus settings and modes • Select a suitable location with dynamic subjects (e.g., people, wildlife, sports) • Set your ISO to a fixed value of 200 for consistent exposure • Ensure your lens is clean to avoid distortion in your images • Practice locating and selecting focus points manually on your camera The Assignment Technical Focus • Use AF-C (Continuous AF) mode when photographing moving subjects • Select a single point focus area for precise control over your focus point • Utilize back-button focus for better timing and to avoid focus-recomposing errors • Maintain a shutter speed fast enough to freeze motion based on your focal length • Experiment with different focus area settings (e.g., zone, expanded) based on subject size Creative Focus • Capture portraits by focusing on the subject's closest eye for sharpness • Try to anticipate the movement of your subject and pre-focus on expected points of action • Play with depth of field by using aperture priority to isolate your subject from the background • Use leading lines to direct attention towards your focused subject in the composition • Experiment with different angles and distances to find unique perspectives on your subjects Assignment Tasks • Use shutter priority mode at 1/500s with ISO 200 fixed to capture a moving subject like a cyclist or a pet in action. • Set your camera to aperture priority mode at f/2.8 with ISO 200 fixed, and photograph a portrait, ensuring to focus on the nearest eye. • In a crowded area, use AF-C mode with a single point focus to track a moving child playing in the park. • Practice using back-button focus while shooting a bird in flight, utilizing shutter priority mode at 1/1000s with ISO 200 fixed. • Find a subject with repetitive movement (like a dancer) and use aperture priority at f/4 with ISO 200 to capture sharp images while blurring the background. • Set your camera to AF-C mode and photograph a car driving by using shutter priority at 1/250s with ISO 200 fixed, ensuring to keep the leading edge of the car in focus. 💡 Stretch Tasks • Challenge yourself to capture a sports event using a zone focus area setting to track multiple players in motion. • Create a series of images with varying depth of field while focusing on the same subject, switching between different aperture settings. DO / DON'T DO • ✓ Do match your autofocus mode to your subject's movement (AF-C for moving subjects). • ✓ Do prioritize the eye as the focus point when photographing people. • ✓ Do practice using different focus areas to see which works best for various subjects. • ✓ Do keep your camera steady using a tripod or stabilizing techniques, especially at slower shutter speeds. • ✓ Do review your images after shooting to assess focus accuracy and make adjustments for next time. DON'T • ✗ Don't rely on focus-recompose techniques when using wide apertures, as this can lead to missed focus. • ✗ Don't use AF-S mode for subjects that are in motion, as it will not track them effectively. • ✗ Don't set your ISO to auto; keep it fixed at 200 for consistent exposure. • ✗ Don't forget to check your focus point before taking a shot, especially in crowded scenes. • ✗ Don't shoot without considering your shutter speed relative to your focal length to avoid motion blur. Reflection Questions • How did changing autofocus modes affect your ability to capture sharp images of moving subjects? • What challenges did you face when trying to focus on the nearest eye during portrait photography? • In what scenarios did you find back-button focus to be particularly useful or challenging? • How does depth of field influence the way you compose your shots, especially with moving subjects? 📚 Related Reading Before you start, read these related blog posts to deepen your understanding: • → What Is Focus In Photography For Foundation Plus members: Submit 3 images from this assignment for personalised feedback in your next Zoom session.
